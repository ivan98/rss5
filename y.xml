    <title>China's factory activity falls in January as Wuhan coronavirus fears grow</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.646364+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;BEIJING: China's manufacturing activity slipped in January, official data showed on Friday (Jan 31), as the country grapples with a new virus that has claimed more than 200 lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Official figures released on Friday showed that the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, an early gauge of factory activity, came in at 50.0, down slightly from 50.2 in the month before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A reading above 50 indicates the sector is expanding while below 50 shows a contraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The findings come as China battles the spread of a new virus that has caused an unprecedented shutdown of transport and manufacturing in China, and locked down much of Hubei province - the epicentre of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/wuhan-virus-death-toll-china-cases-12372588" target=_blank &gt;READ: Wuhan virus death toll hits 213 in China, nearly 10,000 infected&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/wuhan-virus-outbreak-at-a-glance-12323338" target=_blank &gt;READ: Wuhan virus outbreak - At a glance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the National Bureau of Statistics warned that because the survey was conducted before Jan 20, "the impact of pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus has not yet (been) fully manifested".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Future trends will need further observation," it said in a statement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first cases of the outbreak appeared in early December, but many of the restrictions came into effect over the last week, after the data were gathered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would disregard today's release," said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ, in an email to Reuters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"The figure certainly overrates the economic outlook as it does not reflect the interruption due to the outbreak," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/wuhan-virus-singapore-economy-impacted-josephine-teo-12370742" target=_blank &gt;READ: Wuhan virus - Singapore's economy will be impacted, but is diversified enough to mitigate uncertainty, says Manpower Minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The PMI's component indicators painted a mixed picture of the sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New export orders slipped back into contraction after rising for the first time in over a year in December while production slowed from a multi-month high but remained in expansionary territory. Total new orders expanded at a slightly faster clip than the month before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demand ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday was said to have contributed to December's expansion after a tough year for China as it underwent a bruising trade war with the United States. China's economic growth cooled to its weakest in nearly 30 years in 2019.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But despite a partial trade deal signed in mid-January, the latest numbers come as China took a hit in recent weeks from the spread of the new virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sub-index for imports fell deeper into contraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Factories also continued to shed jobs in January, although the pace of reduction slowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China watchers typically advise caution in their analysis of economic data early in the year due to the effect of the week-long Chinese New Year holidays, which usually slows activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many firms scale back operations or close for long periods around the holidays, which began on Jan 24 this year. This year, China's government extended the Chinese New Year holidays to limit the spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/wuhan-virus-how-prepared-your-company-work-flexible-continuity-12369936" target=_blank &gt;Commentary: Wuhan virus – how prepared is your company? What gets green, amber and red rankings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, activity in China's service sector quickened with the official non-manufacturing PMI rising to 54.1 from 53.5 in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the outbreak has been seen hitting service sectors such as transportation, tourism, catering and entertainment as people avoid crowded areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese holidaymakers have been staying home in a highly unusual Chinese New Year this year as local authorities closed public attractions, cancelled major events and urged people to avoid large gatherings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cinemas around China have closed as well during what is generally a prime time for blockbuster releases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other countries have told their citizens to avoid travel to China, with several airlines trimming back their schedules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/wuhan-virus-who-international-emergency-declare-12372372" target=_blank &gt;READ: WHO declares international emergency over Wuhan virus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://bit.ly/38UB0lH" target=_self &gt;LISTEN: Wuhan virus – The WHO, Singapore's infectious diseases authority and a global outbreak expert answer your burning questions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers, too, are not taking any chances, with Taiwanese tech giant Foxconn keeping its Chinese factories closed until mid-February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toyota, IKEA, Starbucks, Tesla, McDonald's and Volkswagen were among the corporate giants temporarily freezing production or closing large numbers of outlets in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The holidays may mean there is little immediate impact on auto-manufacturers' production, but there is growing concern surrounding the virus' longer-term effects on the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Extended closures could ripple through supply chains across China and beyond," Capital Economics said in a note to clients this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-picture--article is-original" data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;img alt="Wuhan virus table Jan 31" class="picture__image lazyload" data-src="/image/12372716/0x0/600/893/81309ce2952457a0064abde6d0fd5c96/cd/wuhan-virus-table-jan-31.jpg"/&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Analysts estimated its impact on China's economy could be bigger than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which also originated in China and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One bright spot might be construction, Capital Economics said in a note, with the sub-index for the industry rising to 59.7 in January from 56.7, a sign local governments have been quick to begin new infrastructure projects this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect a big plunge of both manufacturing and service PMIs in February and March due to the coronavirus outbreak," Ting Lu, chief china economist at Nomura, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beijing will try to provide liquidity and credit support to the economy, especially to businesses severely hit by the outbreak, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, it seems unlikely that these measures would turn the economy around in Q1 and part of Q2, as the virus outbreak may further weaken domestic demand and thus render the upcoming policy easing less effective."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://cna.asia/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan Coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;​​​​​​​&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;SEOUL: A charter flight carrying 368 South Koreans from Wuhan arrived home on Friday (Jan 31) as tensions simmered around quarantine centres where they will be isolated, a plan vehemently opposed by nearby residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first of up to four flights planned to evacuate South Koreans from the &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-death-toll-china-cases-12372588" target=_blank &gt;epicentre of a virus outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in China landed at the Gimpo International Airport west of Seoul around 8am (2300 GMT) after an unexpected half-day delay because China only approved one flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-south-korea-local-transmission-human-12371292" target=_blank &gt;READ: South Korea reports local human-to-human virus transmission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government had said none of the evacuees had any symptoms before departure, but one person could not board the plane due to fever after a final check at Wuhan airport, while 18 were sent to hospitals immediately upon arrival, vice health minister Kim Gang-lip said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There were different screening standards between China and us, and we conducted another check aboard the plane and put those who were showing symptoms in separate space on the second floor of the plane," Kim told a briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The other 350 will be sent to temporary lodging facilities where medical staff will provide daily quarantine and medical assistance for 14 days under thorough control without going out or receiving guests."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The evacuees will be isolated at two facilities in Asan and Jincheon, cities about 80km south of capital Seoul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://bit.ly/38UB0lH" target=_self &gt;LISTEN: Wuhan virus – The WHO, Singapore's infectious diseases authority and a global outbreak expert answer your burning questions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan triggered a strong backlash among nearby residents, with some people throwing eggs and expletives on Thursday at senior officials who visited to try to defuse their anger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several hundred police officers were on hand at the facilities in Asan and Jincheon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Asan, there was no sign of a major rally on Friday morning, but one angry protestor ripped apart a banner put up by a local civic group to welcome the evacuees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 720 South Koreans have signed up for charter flights, but Seoul's foreign ministry said they might have to reduce the number of flights to one or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Korea also reported its seventh confirmed case of the coronavirus on Friday, a 28-year-old man who returned from Wuhan via the eastern Chinese port city of Qingdao last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak has prompted North Korea to declare a state emergency, though it is unclear whether there are any confirmed cases in the isolated nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two Koreas opened a new hotline between Seoul and Pyongyang after they agreed to temporarily close their joint liaison office in the North's border city until virus concerns are eased, the South's Unification Ministry said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The North also informed the South via the hotline that it has decided to postpone plans to remove South Korean facilities at its Mount Kumgang resort next month to prevent a virus outbreak, the ministry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage of the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram" target=_blank &gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Chinese communities in Italy warn of 'racism' over Wuhan coronavirus</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.646291+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;ROME: Prominent figures in Chinese communities in Italy warned Thursday (Jan 30) of episodes of "latent racism" against their compatriots by Italians fearful of catching a deadly viral outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tensions increased after about 7,000 people &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/wuhan-virus-italy-cruise-ship-lockdown-12372508" target=_blank &gt;were held on a cruise ship&lt;/a&gt; in an Italian port following the isolation of two Chinese passengers over fears they could be carrying the coronavirus, despite preliminary tests coming up negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Italian newspapers have reported cases of bullying or discrimination against Chinese people following the outbreak of the disease, which has now killed 170 in China and has spread abroad, with at least 15 countries confirming infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's extremely unpleasant, absurd, and infuriating," Francesco Wu, a member of the Italian Business Association Confcommercio, often called on to speak for the 30,000-strong Chinese community in Milan, told La Stampa daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Racist episodes reportedly included Chinese tourists being spat at in Venice, a family in Turin being accused of carrying the disease, and mothers in Milan using social media to call for Italian children to be kept away from Chinese classmates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's totally unjustified and it hurts even more because it involves children. It's a mix of ignorance and latent racism," Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/wuhan-virus-who-international-emergency-declare-12372372" target=_blank &gt;READ: WHO declares international emergency over Wuhan virus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local health officials have sent the schools concerned a letter stating that "there is no need to introduce measures restricting the presence of Chinese children within school communities," according to AGI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 300,000 Chinese living in Italy at the end of 2018, according to the National Statistics Institute (Istat).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Italy has not had any confirmed cases of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite that, Milan mayor Giuseppe Sala said Chinese tourism - worth €300 million (US$330 million) a month to the city between hotels, shopping and restaurants - was down 40 per cent compared to before the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese journalist Hu Lanbo, who has lived in Italy for 30 years and who runs the "China in Italy" monthly, published an open letter "to Italian friends".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Believing that one can catch the new coronavirus at the mere sight of a Chinese person really makes no sense," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage of the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram" target=_blank &gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>China to fly overseas citizens back to virus-hit Hubei province</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.646254+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;BEIJING: The Chinese government has decided to send charter planes to bring citizens from virus-hit Hubei province who are overseas back "as soon as possible", the foreign affairs ministry said Friday (Jan 31).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In view of the practical difficulties that Chinese citizens from Hubei, especially Wuhan, have faced overseas, the Chinese government has decided to send charter flights to take them directly back to Wuhan as soon as possible," said Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=c-embed-social--twitter  data-css=c-embed-social &gt;&lt;blockquote class=twitter-tweet &gt;&lt;p dir=ltr  lang=en &gt;JUST IN: China has decided to send planes to bring back Chinese from Hubei, especially Wuhan, back from overseas.

AFP reporters saw long queues at hospitals, with some patients saying they queued for two days to see a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pathogen is believed to have emerged in a market that sold wild game, and spread during a Chinese New Year holiday season in which hundreds of millions of Chinese travel at home or abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

It was good to catch up with old friends and exchange views on what more we can do together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are close neighbours and must continue to work together for our mutual benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He returned to Singapore on Thursday evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>China banks borrow from SARS playbook in preparation for market reopening</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.646180+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI: Chinese financial firms will deploy measures used during the SARS outbreak nearly two decades ago to combat the new virus when markets reopen next week, with traders set to work shifts and sales staff restricted to online-only pitches, sources said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Banks and brokers will also be paying double next week for the essential staff in financial capital Shanghai who will be working from Monday (Feb 3) when markets reopen after the extended Chinese New Year holiday, they said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;China's stock and bond markets are the second-largest in the world, with equities trading in Shanghai averaging 222.9 billion yuan (US$32.29 billion) a day in 2019 and the interbank bond market averaging 836 billion yuan, according to the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the central bank, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mainland markets were due to reopen on Friday following a week-long break but the holiday was extended to Monday by central government officials in an effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus that has so far killed more than 200.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bank compliance rules mean that while staff such as analysts can work from home, traders must work from the office using secure internal systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shanghai government has told companies not to allow workers back before Feb 9. Banks, however, are deemed to be providing an essential service and are required to re-open nationwide on Monday, and staff called to work must be paid double on holidays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;China Construction Bank (CCB), the country's second-largest lender, and Hang Seng Bank are among those planning to split their trading teams and alternate their working days, according to three sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HSBC is also considering a shift system for trading teams that have to be in the office, according to one source.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CCB and HSBC did not respond to requests for comment specifically on their trading plans. Hang Seng bank confirmed it would arrange trading shifts and would tell other staff where possible to work from home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The People's Bank of China and the Shanghai Stock Exchange did not respond immediately to a request for comment due to the holiday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;China's new virus belongs to the same coronavirus family as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which also originated in China, and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fund manager at the investment arm of the People's Insurance Company (Group) of China said the virus wouldn't deter people from trading when the market opens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"People in the market are eager to trade," he said. "It's about money. You're disadvantaged if others trade but you don't."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;China Asset Management Co Ltd said its fund managers are required to work from the office to meet compliance rules. One member of its marketing team said the company would use online marketing rather than physical roadshows to promote new products in the near-term.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Even if you want to meet investors in flesh, they don't necessarily want to meet you," he said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Commentary: Jiayou! A community in crisis but Wuhan residents fight back with calls for solidarity</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.646107+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;GUEPLH, Ontario: In Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, residents have been shouting &lt;em&gt;“Wuhan jiayou” &lt;/em&gt;meaning, “Wuhan, stay strong” out of their windows, from apartment building to apartment building, to send words of encouragement to fellow citizens, doctors and medical staff at the front lines of the battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When facing a crisis, humans historically seek solidarity. Community solidarity is often seen as a great way for the community to feel alive and charged with energy after facing hard times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This solidarity was seen after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005 and after Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, there are tales of neighbours shovelling each other out of their homes after the historic snowstorm in Canada. Near Manila, strangers offered up their homes to evacuees of the Taal volcano eruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how do you show community solidarity in the face of a crisis when speaking with your neighbours — and coming together — could literally kill you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12366040/16x9/320/180/a2cbe355492e49abcc056e5f1f9b42d0/QC/aerial-view-of-wuhan-city-during-virus-outbreak.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12366040/16x9/360/203/a2cbe355492e49abcc056e5f1f9b42d0/Ca/aerial-view-of-wuhan-city-during-virus-outbreak.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12366040/16x9/450/253/a2cbe355492e49abcc056e5f1f9b42d0/IX/aerial-view-of-wuhan-city-during-virus-outbreak.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12366040/16x9/550/309/a2cbe355492e49abcc056e5f1f9b42d0/ey/aerial-view-of-wuhan-city-during-virus-outbreak.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12366040/16x9/670/377/a2cbe355492e49abcc056e5f1f9b42d0/iq/aerial-view-of-wuhan-city-during-virus-outbreak.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12366040/16x9/768/432/a2cbe355492e49abcc056e5f1f9b42d0/si/aerial-view-of-wuhan-city-during-virus-outbreak.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12366040/16x9/991/557/a2cbe355492e49abcc056e5f1f9b42d0/eg/aerial-view-of-wuhan-city-during-virus-outbreak.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="Aerial view of Wuhan city during virus outbreak" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; An aerial view shows residential and commercial buildings of Wuhan in China's central Hubei province on Jan 27, 2020, amid a deadly virus outbreak which began in the city.

As fears grew, some felt the need to boost morale and create a sense of community solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, social media posts circulated asking residents in Wuhan to go to their windows and shout out &lt;em&gt;“jiayou”&lt;/em&gt; starting at 8 pm local time. The posts were widely shared, leading to the phenomenon that took place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jiayou&lt;/em&gt; directly translates to “add oil” in a way that might mean “add gasoline to your car” so you can continue to push hard and do what you need to do. In a general sense, the sentiment is “stay strong” or “keep going”. &lt;em&gt;Jiayou&lt;/em&gt; is a common phrase used to encourage someone if they are facing a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the city of Wuhan faces the life and death challenge of the coronavirus, &lt;em&gt;jiayou&lt;/em&gt; works as a phrase that resonates with residents of a city struggling to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12366038/16x9/320/180/a8708b027d465f082c1eb5809314e536/cm/empty-hotel-lobby-wuhan-virus.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12366038/16x9/360/203/a8708b027d465f082c1eb5809314e536/PK/empty-hotel-lobby-wuhan-virus.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12366038/16x9/450/253/a8708b027d465f082c1eb5809314e536/FX/empty-hotel-lobby-wuhan-virus.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12366038/16x9/550/309/a8708b027d465f082c1eb5809314e536/nS/empty-hotel-lobby-wuhan-virus.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12366038/16x9/670/377/a8708b027d465f082c1eb5809314e536/mu/empty-hotel-lobby-wuhan-virus.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12366038/16x9/768/432/a8708b027d465f082c1eb5809314e536/wm/empty-hotel-lobby-wuhan-virus.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12366038/16x9/991/557/a8708b027d465f082c1eb5809314e536/FY/empty-hotel-lobby-wuhan-virus.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="Empty hotel lobby Wuhan virus" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; The first floor level looking out over the hotel lobby is pictured deserted as guests and visitors stay away due to the SARS-like virus affecting the city of Wuhan in Hubei province on Jan 29, 2020.

The images and videos shared of Wuhan are of a ravaged and scary ghost town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some include videos of overflowing hospitals and medical staff in heavy protective gear. Others have spread stories of apocalyptic fear.

But he did not create a space for questions about accountability and government action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is often the double-edged sword of community solidarity: It is powerful, but it can also be appropriated by the powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://cna.asia/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan Coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram " target=_blank &gt;https://cna.asia/telegram &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yvonne Su has a PhD in International Development and Political Science from the University of Guelph.

    <title>Malaysia to send 18 million medical gloves to Wuhan for healthcare workers amid coronavirus outbreak</title>

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian government will be sending 18 million pieces of medical gloves to healthcare workers in Wuhan amid an escalating coronavirus outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement on Friday (Jan 31), Primary Industries Minister Teresa Kok said Malaysia is in full solidarity with the people of Wuhan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“At present, hospitals in Wuhan, the Central Chinese city, at the crux of the coronavirus outbreak, are calling out for much needed protective medical supplies such as masks, suits and gloves, as supplies run low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The medical gloves, both natural rubber and nitrile, will be sent to China in batches with the first shipment being already on its way to Wuhan,” she said. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-malaysia-case-total-12369772" target=_blank &gt;READ: Malaysia confirms new case of Wuhan virus; total of 8 infected&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Kok said that her ministry had obtained the cooperation of the Malaysian Rubber Export Promotion Council (MREPC) and rubber gloves manufacturers in Malaysia on the initiative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was during the Chinese New Year period but the companies stepped forward and gave their commitment in ensuring this initiative would be a success, she said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Malaysian glove industry players are prepared to be at the forefront of supplying high-quality medical gloves to the world, especially in critical times such as this to battle against the outbreak and the current pandemic," she said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two companies, Top Glove and Supermax have already donated 2.3 million pieces of gloves through their local offices and distributors to Wuhan, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12336426/16x9/320/180/9c4c202c313ca70c9753120d35cb01ec/Eq/people-in-wuhan-are-buying-medical-supplies-in-pharmacies-where-staff-wear-full-body-suits-gloves-and-masks-1579946234865-7.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12336426/16x9/360/203/9c4c202c313ca70c9753120d35cb01ec/rO/people-in-wuhan-are-buying-medical-supplies-in-pharmacies-where-staff-wear-full-body-suits-gloves-and-masks-1579946234865-7.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12336426/16x9/450/253/9c4c202c313ca70c9753120d35cb01ec/uH/people-in-wuhan-are-buying-medical-supplies-in-pharmacies-where-staff-wear-full-body-suits-gloves-and-masks-1579946234865-7.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12336426/16x9/550/309/9c4c202c313ca70c9753120d35cb01ec/Oq/people-in-wuhan-are-buying-medical-supplies-in-pharmacies-where-staff-wear-full-body-suits-gloves-and-masks-1579946234865-7.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12336426/16x9/670/377/9c4c202c313ca70c9753120d35cb01ec/Nm/people-in-wuhan-are-buying-medical-supplies-in-pharmacies-where-staff-wear-full-body-suits-gloves-and-masks-1579946234865-7.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12336426/16x9/768/432/9c4c202c313ca70c9753120d35cb01ec/Xe/people-in-wuhan-are-buying-medical-supplies-in-pharmacies-where-staff-wear-full-body-suits-gloves-and-masks-1579946234865-7.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12336426/16x9/991/557/9c4c202c313ca70c9753120d35cb01ec/Jc/people-in-wuhan-are-buying-medical-supplies-in-pharmacies-where-staff-wear-full-body-suits-gloves-and-masks-1579946234865-7.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="People in Wuhan are buying medical supplies in pharmacies where staff wear full body-suits, gloves" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; People in Wuhan are buying medical supplies in pharmacies where staff wear full body-suits, gloves and masks.

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;BEIJING: Countries are scrambling to airlift their citizens from the Chinese city of Wuhan as it struggles to get to grips with the spread of a SARS-like virus which has claimed more than 200 lives nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States, Japan and Singapore are among nations that have already sent aircraft to remove their nationals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;China has sealed off the city, effectively quarantining more than 50 million people in Hubei province, including thousands of foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-death-toll-china-cases-12372588" target=_self &gt;READ: Wuhan virus death toll hits 213 in China, nearly 10,000 infected&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are five questions on the evacuation efforts answered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT ARE THE RISKS? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Authorities will have to "really, really clean the airports and prevent transmission at every step of the logistics - it's a huge risk", said Wang Linfa, director of the Emerging Infectious Diseases programme at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Air Transport Association (IATA) says the risk of contracting a disease on board a plane is in general similar to other confined, crowded spaces such as buses or trains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That said, the risk on airplanes is probably lower than in many confined spaces because modern planes have cabin air filtration systems equipped with HEPA filters," it adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-picture--article is-original" data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;img alt="Singaporeans return from Wuhan" class="picture__image lazyload" data-src="/image/12369714/0x0/1080/810/d85e5d57a302a216d7432c6ee58b3d70/qi/singaporeans-return-from-wuhan.jpg"/&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Singaporeans returning home from Wuhan on Jan 30, 2020.

They said that initially none of them had tested positive for the virus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"The overall risk of infection in Thailand is still low, but people should take precautions to protect themselves," Tanarak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thailand's previous cases have all been either Chinese tourists or Thais who had visited China, where the virus originated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The taxi driver is one of five other coronavirus cases confirmed in Thailand on Friday. The other four patients are Chinese nationals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seven of Thailand's 19 cases have recovered and gone home while 12 are still being treated at hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All but two of the cases are Chinese tourists visiting the country, the health authority said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thailand is sending a plane to Wuhan to bring back about 161 citizens on Saturday, a government minister said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-embed-social--twitter  data-css=c-embed-social &gt;&lt;blockquote class=twitter-tweet &gt;&lt;p dir=ltr  lang=en &gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Thailand?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Thailand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/health?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#health&lt;/a&gt; officials say the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Thai?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Thai&lt;/a&gt; taxi driver stopped driving when he felt ill.

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Dhaka is awash with millions of plastic-laminated campaign posters ahead of elections in the Bangladeshi capital, and environmentalists are up in arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These posters - of which there are an estimated 304 million - will likely end up in sewers, rivers and canals, says activist Sharif Jamil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;"If they are burnt, they will pollute the air," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city's air quality has been ranked one of the worst in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-picture--article is-original" data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;img alt="Dhaka is awash with millions of plastic-laminated campaign posters ahead of elections" class="picture__image lazyload" data-src="/image/12374394/0x0/768/511/68dfb4b06ff4986fbe782a36f5206e02/xV/dhaka-is-awash-with-millions-of-plastic-laminated-campaign-posters-ahead-of-elections-1580464359393-3.jpg"/&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Dhaka is awash with millions of plastic-laminated campaign posters ahead of elections.

Black-and-white posters continue to festoon the streets and parks of the congested, cacophonous metropolis of 18 million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manjur Hossain, head of Dhaka City Corporation's waste management department, said they would deal with the waste after the polls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will separately manage it," he told AFP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

He arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 26, and reported to be asymptomatic on his flight but developed symptoms on Jan 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He sought medical treatment at a clinic on Thursday and was taken to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) in an ambulance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man tested positive for the coronavirus at about 11pm on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;He is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. Prior to admission, the man stayed at home in Jurong East Street 13. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 15th case is a 47-year-old Singaporean, who had travelled to Wuhan with her family and was one of the 92 &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wuhan-virus-singaporeans-scoot-flown-home-changi-12369704" target=_blank &gt;Singaporeans who were evacuated from the city&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was asymptomatic when she boarded the flight, but was found to have a fever during the medical screening at Changi Airport and was taken to NCID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She tested positive for the coronavirus at about 2pm on Friday and is warded in an isolation room at NCID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 16th case is a 38-year-old Chinese man who arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 22. He tested positive for the coronavirus at about 2pm on Friday and is currently warded in an isolation room at the Singapore General Hospital. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three cases are in stable condition, said MOH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wuhan-virus-outbreak-at-a-glance-12323338" target=_blank &gt;READ: Wuhan virus outbreak - At a glance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PREVIOUS CASES ALL IN STABLE CONDITION: MOH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The death toll in China has &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/wuhan-virus-death-toll-china-cases-12372588" target=_blank &gt;risen to 213&lt;/a&gt;, with nearly 10,000 infected, according to official figures released on Friday. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the situation &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/wuhan-virus-who-international-emergency-declare-12372372" target=_blank &gt;a global emergency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wuhan-virus-singapore-what-we-know-confirmed-cases-12324270" target=_blank &gt;13 previously confirmed cases in Singapore&lt;/a&gt; came from Wuhan in Hubei province. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first case of the Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore was confirmed on Jan 23 - about a month after the first cases were reported in the Chinese city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seven men and six women, aged between 31 and 73, are being treated at isolation wards at &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wuhan-virus-pneumonia-national-centre-infectious-diseases-12297584" target=_blank &gt;NCID&lt;/a&gt;, Changi General Hospital, Singapore General Hospital and Sengkang General Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its press release on Friday, MOH shared more information about the 13th confirmed case, a 73-year-old woman who arrived in Singapore on Jan 21. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry said she was a close contact of the second confirmed case and multiple attempts were made to contact her. She was located on Jan 28 and reported having developed symptoms on the same day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman was taken to NCID, where she was isolated, and she tested positive for the coronavirus at about 2pm on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOH said that prior to her admission, the woman stayed at ParkRoyal Collection Pickering and Oasia Hotel Downtown, and visited Changi Airport and Jewel. She travelled by taxi and private transport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of the 13 previously confirmed cases are critically ill, said the ministry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All of them remain in stable condition and most are improving," it added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of noon on Friday, 198 of the suspected cases have tested negative for the virus. Test results for the remaining 35 cases are pending. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOH also said that it has identified 202 close contacts as of noon on Friday.

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;YANGON: Myanmar on Friday (Jan 31) sent a plane back to China with most passengers still on board - including French and American citizens - after one man suspected of contracting the coronavirus was taken to hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No cases of the pathogen that has &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-death-toll-china-cases-12372588" target=_blank &gt;killed 213 people in China&lt;/a&gt; have been reported in Myanmar so far but fears have been growing in the impoverished Southeast Asian nation that shares a border with its powerful neighbour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;A total of 79 people were on board the China Southern Airline flight from Guangzhou, including two Americans, two French, two Myanmar, one Columbian and 72 Chinese nationals, according to airport officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-who-international-emergency-declare-12372372" target=_blank &gt;READ: WHO declares international emergency over Wuhan virus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-how-prepared-your-company-work-flexible-continuity-12369936" target=_blank &gt;Commentary: Wuhan virus – how prepared is your company?

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;JAKARTA: More than 40,000 workers at a vast Chinese-controlled industrial complex in Indonesia have been quarantined over fears about the spread of a deadly coronavirus strain which has killed more than 200 people in China, it said Friday (Jan 31).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PT Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park has sealed off its nickel mining hub on Sulawesi island and is barring any of its 43,000 staff from entering or leaving without written permission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are some 5,000 guest workers from mainland China at the sprawling site which hosts nickel ore smelters and stainless steel production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-death-toll-china-cases-12372588" target=_blank &gt;READ: Wuhan virus death toll hits 213 in China, nearly 10,000 infected&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://bit.ly/38UB0lH" target=_self &gt;LISTEN: Wuhan virus – The WHO, Singapore's infectious diseases authority and a global outbreak expert answer your burning questions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employees at the 2,000-hectare facility, majority owned by China's Shanghai Decent Investment Group, are undergoing medical tests and none has been found to be infected so far, said company spokesman Dedy Kurniawan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The firm has also imposed a ban on employees or guests from overseas entering the complex and installed thermal scanners at its entrance, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have identified and screened foreign workers from Wuhan," Kurniawan told AFP on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also stopped accepting foreign workers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia has not reported any confirmed infections so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/wuhan-virus-travel-restrictions-all-visitors-china-12374324" target=_blank &gt;READ: Singapore to widen travel restrictions to all new visitors who recently travelled to mainland China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-evacuations-risks-planes-singapore-scoot-12373370" target=_blank &gt;READ: Evacuations from Wuhan: What are the risks?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, is at the centre of the outbreak which is believed to have originated in a market that sold wild animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city of 11 million has since experienced an unprecedented lockdown, preventing residents from leaving in a bid to stop the deadly virus from spreading further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lockdown at the Indonesian plant, which started at the weekend, comes as Indonesia said Friday it was preparing to evacuate more than 240 nationals stranded in China near the epicentre of the virus within the next 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia, a Southeast Asian archipelago, attracts more than one million Chinese tourists annually to Bali and other holiday hotspots, and also hosts thousands of guest workers from major investor China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>China slams US for travel warning over virus</title>

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;BEIJING: Beijing on Friday (Jan 31) sharply criticised the United States for warning American citizens to avoid China and for urging those already there to leave due to the coronavirus health emergency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Certain US officials' words and actions are neither factual nor appropriate," China's foreign affairs ministry spokesman Hua Chunying said in a statement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Just as the WHO recommended against travel restrictions, the US rushed to go in the opposite way. Certainly not a gesture of goodwill."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US State Department has raised its warning alert to the highest level, telling Americans to avoid China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first case of person-to-person transmission of the virus on American soil was confirmed Thursday - a man in Chicago who caught it from his wife, who had travelled to Wuhan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was also criticised for saying the virus, which has killed 213 people in China, could help "accelerate the return of jobs" to America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ross said the virus was "very unfortunate" but that it was also a "risk factor" for businesses to consider when weighing whether to operate in China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Separately, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, on a visit to London, this week angered Beijing by calling China's ruling Communist Party "the central threat of our times".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://cna.asia/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;​​​​​​​&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Canada gets China nod to bring home citizens amid epidemic</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.645559+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;OTTAWA: Canada's top diplomat has gotten a nod from his Chinese counterpart to bring home nearly 200 Canadians from Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic, his office said Friday (Jan 31).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a rare telephone call with Foreign Minister Wang Yi Thursday night, Canada's Foreign Minister François-Philippe Champagne "asked for the collaboration of the Chinese government in helping those Canadian citizens who want to depart the region."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wang "responded positively," he said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ottawa chartered a plane to bring back 196 Canadians who asked to be repatriated, but the airlift had remained in limbo this week even as the United States, Japan, South Korea and European nations brought home their nationals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Wuhan locked down as part of a government effort to contain the epidemic, the Canadian flight required authorization to land in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada's relations with its second biggest trading partner have been strained since the arrest on a US warrant of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in December 2018 during a flight stopover in Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;China has detained two Canadians, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, in apparent retaliation. It also blocked Canadian agricultural shipments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first phase of a court hearing of a US request for Meng's extradition was held earlier this month, and is scheduled to resume in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kovrig and Spavor, meanwhile, remain in China's opaque penal system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Champagne's office said he also raised the plight of the detained Canadians with Wang, adding: "The two agreed to remain in touch on issues of mutual importance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and US President Donald Trump agreed in a telephone call "on the need for (Kovrig and Spavor's) immediate release."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a 50-year-old Toronto man who had contracted the coronavirus during a trip to China - Canada's first of three confirmed cases - has been released from hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over the course of the week, his status continued to improve to the point where he no longer required in-patient care," Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Commentary: International law has its limits in protecting the Rohingya in Myanmar</title>

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;BOSTON, Massachusetts: Myanmar has been ordered by the International Court of Justice to take “provisional measures” to protect the Rohingya, an ethnic Muslim minority in the Buddhist-majority country that has suffered “mass killing, mass displacement, mass fear [and] overwhelming … brutality” at the hands of the military.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 700,000 Rohingya fled or were forced out of the country since 2016, most to neighbouring Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The order comes after the African state of Gambia in November 2019 filed a complaint of genocide of the Rohingya against Myanmar with the International Court of Justice, the judicial organ of the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the 1948 Genocide Convention, genocide requires a specific intent to destroy a group in whole or in part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/myanmar-already-protecting-rohingya--ruling-party-says-after-world-court-s-order-12325638" target=_blank &gt;READ: Myanmar already protecting Rohingya, ruling party says after world court's order&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations (UN) General Assembly and numerous human rights organisations have for years condemned Myanmar’s attacks on the Rohingya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The country – which was slowly emerging from the global economic and political isolation that followed its 1989 military coup by making some very modest concessions to democracy – has also been subjected to new sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is the first judicial intervention in the crisis. Can international law protect the Rohingya when diplomacy, politics and sanctions have failed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTERNATIONAL LAW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike domestic courts – whose judgments can be enforced by sheriffs, seizures of property, fines and even imprisonment – international courts have no police forces at their disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Court of Justice can call on the UN Security Council, which is responsible for responding to threats to and breaches of international peace, to enforce its orders. However, Security Council action can be vetoed by any one of its five permanent members, which includes Myanmar’s ally, China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/china-xi-jinping-myanmar-mr-shithole-facebook-translation-error-12290792" target=_blank &gt;READ: Commentary: Facebook's Xi Jinping's name gaffe is no laughing matter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12367428/16x9/320/180/1f34db2069ecc8dc89b781a0be54e4e2/VB/file-photo--a-child-reads-a-book-in-a-makeshift-school-run-by-rohingya-teachers-in-kutupalong-refugee-camp-in-cox-s-bazar--bangladesh-3.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12367428/16x9/360/203/1f34db2069ecc8dc89b781a0be54e4e2/XJ/file-photo--a-child-reads-a-book-in-a-makeshift-school-run-by-rohingya-teachers-in-kutupalong-refugee-camp-in-cox-s-bazar--bangladesh-3.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12367428/16x9/450/253/1f34db2069ecc8dc89b781a0be54e4e2/hm/file-photo--a-child-reads-a-book-in-a-makeshift-school-run-by-rohingya-teachers-in-kutupalong-refugee-camp-in-cox-s-bazar--bangladesh-3.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12367428/16x9/550/309/1f34db2069ecc8dc89b781a0be54e4e2/HB/file-photo--a-child-reads-a-book-in-a-makeshift-school-run-by-rohingya-teachers-in-kutupalong-refugee-camp-in-cox-s-bazar--bangladesh-3.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12367428/16x9/670/377/1f34db2069ecc8dc89b781a0be54e4e2/SN/file-photo--a-child-reads-a-book-in-a-makeshift-school-run-by-rohingya-teachers-in-kutupalong-refugee-camp-in-cox-s-bazar--bangladesh-3.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12367428/16x9/768/432/1f34db2069ecc8dc89b781a0be54e4e2/cF/file-photo--a-child-reads-a-book-in-a-makeshift-school-run-by-rohingya-teachers-in-kutupalong-refugee-camp-in-cox-s-bazar--bangladesh-3.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12367428/16x9/991/557/1f34db2069ecc8dc89b781a0be54e4e2/Tf/file-photo--a-child-reads-a-book-in-a-makeshift-school-run-by-rohingya-teachers-in-kutupalong-refugee-camp-in-cox-s-bazar--bangladesh-3.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="FILE PHOTO: A child reads a book in a makeshift school run by Rohingya teachers in Kutupalong refug" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; FILE PHOTO: A child reads a book in a makeshift school run by Rohingya teachers in Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, February 7, 2019.

It is often better at delivering remedies to victims of human rights violations than in changing dictatorships into democracies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I do agree with late Columbia Law School professor Louis Henkin, who observed more than 40 years ago: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all nations observe almost all principles of international law and almost all of their obligations almost all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MYANMAR HAS OPTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court’s four orders to Myanmar were very limited in scope, which may increase the likelihood of compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first two measures ordered simply call on Myanmar not to violate its obligations under the Genocide Convention. In other words, it must neither commit genocide nor allow genocide to be committed within its territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/aung-san-suu-kyi-un-icj-hague-genocide-intent-myanmar-rohingya-12181322" target=_blank &gt;READ: Commentary: Proving Myanmar had genocidal intent is not straightforward&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myanmar’s leader – Nobel laureate and former human rights icon Aung San Suu Kyi – denies that genocide occurred in Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, she argued before the court that Gambia’s allegations were “incomplete and misleading". She said they “ignored the conflict between armed groups and the Myanmar military in Rakhine State,” where most Rohingya live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aung San Suu Kyi did concede that the military might have used “disproportionate force,” potentially “in disregard of international humanitarian law".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12309654/16x9/320/180/261b76fab4e76703d52dcbd476246284/JU/myanmar-s-civilian-leader-aung-san-suu-kyi-travelled-to-the-hague-in-december-to-personally-defend-her-buddhist-majority-country-against-the-allegations-over-the-bloody-2017-crackdown-against-the-rohi-1579757802135-2.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12309654/16x9/360/203/261b76fab4e76703d52dcbd476246284/jM/myanmar-s-civilian-leader-aung-san-suu-kyi-travelled-to-the-hague-in-december-to-personally-defend-her-buddhist-majority-country-against-the-allegations-over-the-bloody-2017-crackdown-against-the-rohi-1579757802135-2.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12309654/16x9/450/253/261b76fab4e76703d52dcbd476246284/pJ/myanmar-s-civilian-leader-aung-san-suu-kyi-travelled-to-the-hague-in-december-to-personally-defend-her-buddhist-majority-country-against-the-allegations-over-the-bloody-2017-crackdown-against-the-rohi-1579757802135-2.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12309654/16x9/550/309/261b76fab4e76703d52dcbd476246284/bU/myanmar-s-civilian-leader-aung-san-suu-kyi-travelled-to-the-hague-in-december-to-personally-defend-her-buddhist-majority-country-against-the-allegations-over-the-bloody-2017-crackdown-against-the-rohi-1579757802135-2.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12309654/16x9/670/377/261b76fab4e76703d52dcbd476246284/GA/myanmar-s-civilian-leader-aung-san-suu-kyi-travelled-to-the-hague-in-december-to-personally-defend-her-buddhist-majority-country-against-the-allegations-over-the-bloody-2017-crackdown-against-the-rohi-1579757802135-2.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12309654/16x9/768/432/261b76fab4e76703d52dcbd476246284/Ps/myanmar-s-civilian-leader-aung-san-suu-kyi-travelled-to-the-hague-in-december-to-personally-defend-her-buddhist-majority-country-against-the-allegations-over-the-bloody-2017-crackdown-against-the-rohi-1579757802135-2.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12309654/16x9/991/557/261b76fab4e76703d52dcbd476246284/Iu/myanmar-s-civilian-leader-aung-san-suu-kyi-travelled-to-the-hague-in-december-to-personally-defend-her-buddhist-majority-country-against-the-allegations-over-the-bloody-2017-crackdown-against-the-rohi-1579757802135-2.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="Myanmar's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi travelled to The Hague in December to personally" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Myanmar's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi travelled to The Hague in December to personally defend her Buddhist-majority country against the allegations over the bloody 2017 crackdown against the Rohingya AFP/Koen Van WEEL&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent UN report on the Rohingya situation concluded that “there is a serious risk that genocidal actions may occur or recur". However, it also observed that the situation is not as grave as it was during 2016 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myanmar’s representatives told the International Court of Justice in December that it is engaged in “reparation initiatives to facilitate the return of Rohingya refugees” and will “promote ethnic reconciliation, peace and stability".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also said the government “intends to make its military accountable".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judges found these measures insufficient to protect the Rohingya. But Myanmar may nonetheless argue if and when it reports back to the court that such steps essentially meet its Genocide Convention obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court’s third order, to take “effective measures” to preserve all evidence related to the alleged genocide, is more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If obeyed, it could incriminate Myanmar – though even evidence that mass atrocities occurred in Rakhine state does not necessarily prove “genocide".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/aung-san-suu-kyi-icj-rhingya-genocide-hague-myanmar-cleansing-12170476" target=_blank &gt;READ: Commentary: Myanmar doing rather well despite the Lady hauled to Hague for Rohingya's plight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court also ordered that Myanmar update it by May on the measures that it has taken to comply with the court’s orders.

    <title>Commentary: Coronavirus – Where should Koreans evacuated from Wuhan stay?</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.645486+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;SEOUL: In the South Korean city of Asan this week, residents held angry protests decrying their government’s decision to quarantine South Koreans evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the growing outbreak of a new coronavirus, at a facility in their community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the many placards at the protest -- hung between pieces of heavy construction equipment to block the road to the facilities -- was one that read “Asan citizens first.” &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Protest signs are meant to convey simple, snappy messages and don’t have room for much context. But it was clear from this slogan that the people of Asan felt that their government should put them first, that they shouldn’t have to forego any of their interests, or risk their own health, to accommodate fellow citizens fleeing the hub of a public health crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/wuhan-virus-evacuations-risks-planes-singapore-scoot-12373370" target=_blank &gt;READ: Evacuations from Wuhan: What are the risks?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In explaining their opposition, locals have said that the government picked Asan, and another city called Jincheon, as the quarantine sites without consulting them first. They have also pointed out that the quarantine facilities are in densely populated areas, where many children live.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOT IN MY BACKYARD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Social scientists have dubbed this way of thinking NIMBYism, with NIMBY being the acronym for “not in my backyard,” a phenomenon whereby people in a certain location resist some change to the place that they live on no grounds other than that the proposed change, while being necessary or at least beneficial in a general sense for the wider society, isn’t good for their specific community or locality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretty much everyone can agree that a country must have garbage dumps and sewage treatment facilities, yet no one wants those facilities near where they live because of the adverse effects on property values and quality of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://bit.ly/2S6PKqF" target=_blank &gt;LISTEN: Wuhan virus – The WHO, Singapore's infectious diseases authority and a global outbreak expert answer your burning questions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The locals in Asan were not arguing that their fellow South Koreans should be banned from returning to their country or that the national government had no responsibility to help get them out of Wuhan. They simply, for entirely selfish reasons, want them sent elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12373808/16x9/320/180/b5be2b741fca90353982df7c8e1b77f3/uB/a-chartered-plane-carrying-carrying-evacuated-south-koreans-from-wuhan-arrives-at-gimpo-international-airport-in-gimpo-6.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12373808/16x9/360/203/b5be2b741fca90353982df7c8e1b77f3/gZ/a-chartered-plane-carrying-carrying-evacuated-south-koreans-from-wuhan-arrives-at-gimpo-international-airport-in-gimpo-6.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12373808/16x9/450/253/b5be2b741fca90353982df7c8e1b77f3/Gm/a-chartered-plane-carrying-carrying-evacuated-south-koreans-from-wuhan-arrives-at-gimpo-international-airport-in-gimpo-6.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12373808/16x9/550/309/b5be2b741fca90353982df7c8e1b77f3/Uh/a-chartered-plane-carrying-carrying-evacuated-south-koreans-from-wuhan-arrives-at-gimpo-international-airport-in-gimpo-6.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12373808/16x9/670/377/b5be2b741fca90353982df7c8e1b77f3/kJ/a-chartered-plane-carrying-carrying-evacuated-south-koreans-from-wuhan-arrives-at-gimpo-international-airport-in-gimpo-6.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12373808/16x9/768/432/b5be2b741fca90353982df7c8e1b77f3/uB/a-chartered-plane-carrying-carrying-evacuated-south-koreans-from-wuhan-arrives-at-gimpo-international-airport-in-gimpo-6.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12373808/16x9/991/557/b5be2b741fca90353982df7c8e1b77f3/On/a-chartered-plane-carrying-carrying-evacuated-south-koreans-from-wuhan-arrives-at-gimpo-international-airport-in-gimpo-6.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="A chartered plane carrying carrying evacuated South Koreans from Wuhan arrives at Gimpo Internation" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; A chartered Boeing 747-400 plane carrying carrying evacuated South Koreans from Wuhan, the epicenter of a virus outbreak in China, arrives at Gimpo International Airport in Gimpo, South Korea, January 31, 2020.

No South Korean city was likely to raise its hand and volunteer to host hundreds of people who could have been exposed to the deadly, poorly understood virus at this stage of the outbreak, when the number of cases is rising daily and no one knows how bad the outbreak could get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One might have expected that at this stage, cities would be willing to step forward and contribute to the state’s handling of the public health crisis, to shoulder risk and burden as a way of working toward a solution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A NEW FACE OF SOCIETY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case contrasts sharply with a heart-warming story of South Korean cooperation and sacrifice not too long ago. In 1998, as the country was reeling from the Asian Financial Crisis and the national government was billions of dollars in debt, citizens lined up to donate gold to help the nation climb out of debt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/wuhan-virus-how-prepared-your-company-work-flexible-continuity-12369936" target=_blank &gt;READ: Commentary: Wuhan virus – how prepared is your company? What gets green, amber and red rankings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;That story was upheld as demonstration of a deep social bond, of citizens willing to, at a time of economic disaster, give up personal assets to help out the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would anything like that happen today? South Koreans have long lamented that that same crisis in the late 1990s changed their country forever, introducing neoliberal economics, eroding the country’s previous model of jobs for life and family-like companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crisis paved the way for a more competitive, individualistic South Korea where nothing is guaranteed and average citizens, like those who protested in Asan this week, see their society’s elites as corrupt and out of touch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOR THE WIDER GOOD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Korea is a democracy, and democracies require a peculiar balancing of individual rights and collective goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12373814/16x9/320/180/71495ea71981b8b23ec69b3fe3c44496/zG/buses-transporting-south-koreans-evacuees-from-wuhan-leave-after-arriving-at-gimpo-international-airport-in-gimpo-9.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12373814/16x9/360/203/71495ea71981b8b23ec69b3fe3c44496/le/buses-transporting-south-koreans-evacuees-from-wuhan-leave-after-arriving-at-gimpo-international-airport-in-gimpo-9.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12373814/16x9/450/253/71495ea71981b8b23ec69b3fe3c44496/QH/buses-transporting-south-koreans-evacuees-from-wuhan-leave-after-arriving-at-gimpo-international-airport-in-gimpo-9.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12373814/16x9/550/309/71495ea71981b8b23ec69b3fe3c44496/BW/buses-transporting-south-koreans-evacuees-from-wuhan-leave-after-arriving-at-gimpo-international-airport-in-gimpo-9.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12373814/16x9/670/377/71495ea71981b8b23ec69b3fe3c44496/si/buses-transporting-south-koreans-evacuees-from-wuhan-leave-after-arriving-at-gimpo-international-airport-in-gimpo-9.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12373814/16x9/768/432/71495ea71981b8b23ec69b3fe3c44496/DW/buses-transporting-south-koreans-evacuees-from-wuhan-leave-after-arriving-at-gimpo-international-airport-in-gimpo-9.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12373814/16x9/991/557/71495ea71981b8b23ec69b3fe3c44496/zM/buses-transporting-south-koreans-evacuees-from-wuhan-leave-after-arriving-at-gimpo-international-airport-in-gimpo-9.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="Buses transporting South Koreans evacuees from Wuhan leave after arriving at Gimpo International Ai" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Buses transporting South Koreans evacuees from Wuhan, the epicenter of a virus outbreak in China, leave after arriving at Gimpo International Airport in Gimpo, South Korea, January 31, 2020.

At some point, all citizens are asked to grit their teeth and accept things they may not like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In democracies, anyone who fulfils a duty to their state that requires they risk their own life -- career soldiers, police officers, emergency workers -- does so with their own consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/wuhan-virus-social-media-communications-facebook-whatsapp-12364658" target=_blank &gt;READ: Commentary: Wuhan virus - when social media and chat groups complicate crisis communication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preamble to South Korea’s constitution states, the provision of “equal opportunities to every person and provide for the fullest development of individual capabilities” as a goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there is a contradiction in that, as at some point, particular individuals must sacrifice for collective well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LESSONS FROM THE PAST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the first chartered flight carrying 368 Koreans from Wuhan landed at the Gimpo International Airport on Friday (Jan 31) morning amidst continued anger among some residents in Asan and Jincheon, I couldn’t help but ponder about how this could messy situation could have been averted or resolved. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/wuhan-virus-korea-risks-business-work-from-home-business-plans-12323760" target=_blank &gt;READ: Commentary: Allowing employees to work from home can help South Korea manage the Wuhan virus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A potentially effective solution during a dispute like this is a show of leadership, for someone in a position of responsibility to set an example for the concerned citizens of Asan by showing that they are willing to take on some of the burden. Or for someone to show by example – which in this case would have been one of the cities putting up its hands to say they would welcome their evacuated fellow citizens to be quarantined in their neighbourhood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the government has acted more decisively than the last time an epidemic hit the nation – the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2015 – by putting into quarantine and issuing medical assistance to infected persons early while also announcing that it will be drawing from an emergency fund to contain the virus as it aims to calm residents and investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12326754/16x9/320/180/2f3bf08cf53624bf3ad14832c66f8968/cJ/south-korea-wuhan-virus.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12326754/16x9/360/203/2f3bf08cf53624bf3ad14832c66f8968/CB/south-korea-wuhan-virus.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12326754/16x9/450/253/2f3bf08cf53624bf3ad14832c66f8968/nC/south-korea-wuhan-virus.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12326754/16x9/550/309/2f3bf08cf53624bf3ad14832c66f8968/Op/south-korea-wuhan-virus.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12326754/16x9/670/377/2f3bf08cf53624bf3ad14832c66f8968/WR/south-korea-wuhan-virus.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12326754/16x9/768/432/2f3bf08cf53624bf3ad14832c66f8968/gJ/south-korea-wuhan-virus.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12326754/16x9/991/557/2f3bf08cf53624bf3ad14832c66f8968/Uv/south-korea-wuhan-virus.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="South Korea Wuhan virus" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; A worker from a cleaning and disinfection service sprays disinfectant at a train station as part of efforts to prevent the spread of a new virus which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan at Suseo railway station in Seoul on Jan 24, 2020.

But with more than 300 Koreans left to be evacuated from Wuhan, the unrest may yet get new life in the coming days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes the communication from government an ongoing effort to ease citizens’ worries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political leadership handbooks also point to the importance of empathy, of leaders demonstrating that they care how their citizens feel. Asan citizens might feel more at ease if President Moon Jae-in came to their community to walk the city streets and listen to people’s concerns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the very least, that would allow Moon’s government to send the key message: We’re all in this together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our Comprehensive Coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steven Borowiec is the politics editor of Korea Expose.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Cafe chain in Indonesia plans big expansion with investment from Jay-Z and Serena Williams</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.645449+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;JAKARTA: On its first day of business, Kopi Kenangan sold 700 cups of coffee. Within three months, it broke even.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years later, it has 230 outlets across Indonesia, from Medan in North Sumatra to Makassar in South Sulawesi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mr Edward Tirtanata, CEO of this fast-growing coffee chain, decided right at the start that its coffee has to be affordable in order to survive in the competitive market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At an average of 18,000 rupiah (US$1.30) a cup, the pricing of Kopi Kenangan is between the street stalls’ coffee of about 3,000 rupiah and international chains’ 50,000 rupiah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I used a simple logic in my pricing strategy when we first started three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A nice cup of coffee cost between 35,000 and 40,000 rupiah. If you bought one cup a day, that’s 1.2 million rupiah a month, which came up to 30 per cent of minimum wage in Jakarta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“However, a cup of Starbucks in the United States for a month is just 6 per cent of its minimum wage. There’s a big difference. That’s why I decided to price my coffee in a way that a month of consumption will only cost less than 10 per cent of our minimum wage,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial success has given the entrepreneur and his business partners courage to dream big. They want to grow both in Indonesia, which has a robust coffee culture as the world’s fourth largest coffee producer, and elsewhere in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-embed-social--instagram  data-css=c-embed-social &gt;&lt;blockquote class=instagram-media  data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/B6xnc4EhMBT/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version=12  style=" background:#FFF;

Nobody knows this, but I used to sell clothes at Tanah Abang (biggest textile market in Southeast Asia).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I also tried to start a consulting company,” the 31-year-old said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12260992/16x9/320/180/b22e1ddad25f34685c53b0f8954d8996/BF/-ks--edward-tirtanata.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12260992/16x9/360/203/b22e1ddad25f34685c53b0f8954d8996/nd/-ks--edward-tirtanata.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12260992/16x9/450/253/b22e1ddad25f34685c53b0f8954d8996/Di/-ks--edward-tirtanata.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12260992/16x9/550/309/b22e1ddad25f34685c53b0f8954d8996/Vt/-ks--edward-tirtanata.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12260992/16x9/670/377/b22e1ddad25f34685c53b0f8954d8996/fd/-ks--edward-tirtanata.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12260992/16x9/768/432/b22e1ddad25f34685c53b0f8954d8996/pV/-ks--edward-tirtanata.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12260992/16x9/991/557/b22e1ddad25f34685c53b0f8954d8996/Sn/-ks--edward-tirtanata.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="Edward Tirtanata" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Mr Edward Tirtanata wants Kopi Kenangan to go global. (Photo: Kiki Siregar)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;He tasted his first real success when he dabbled into food and beverage business with the opening of a tea lounge in 2015 named Lewis &amp;amp; Carroll, after famous authors C. S. Lewis and Lewis Carroll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years later, he partnered two of his friends Mr James Prananto and Ms Cynthia Chaerunnisa to start a coffee chain with 150 million rupiah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their goal was to offer local high-quality coffee at a price cheaper than international coffee chains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the brand name, they settled with Kopi Kenangan, which translated into Coffee of Memory, with beverages cheekily named Memories of an Ex, Memories of an Ex who is Getting Married and Memories of the Past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Tirtanata knew the strategy worked when customers giggled as they scanned the menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, the partners decided that the taste and quality of the coffee had to be exceptional. Their signature cuppa would be milk coffee with palm sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you are selling milk coffee, the milk is just as important as the coffee. Most likely, a cup of beverage is 70 per cent milk. That’s why I always choose the best milk,” Mr Tirtanata said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their stores are compact with a small seating area as the concept was grab-and-go to cater to the needs of busy cosmopolitans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12260988/16x9/320/180/5f60d5b148a8780adcabaebef21af051/hU/-ks--kopi-kenangan.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12260988/16x9/360/203/5f60d5b148a8780adcabaebef21af051/Ts/-ks--kopi-kenangan.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12260988/16x9/450/253/5f60d5b148a8780adcabaebef21af051/jx/-ks--kopi-kenangan.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12260988/16x9/550/309/5f60d5b148a8780adcabaebef21af051/CI/-ks--kopi-kenangan.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12260988/16x9/670/377/5f60d5b148a8780adcabaebef21af051/MY/-ks--kopi-kenangan.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12260988/16x9/768/432/5f60d5b148a8780adcabaebef21af051/xE/-ks--kopi-kenangan.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12260988/16x9/991/557/5f60d5b148a8780adcabaebef21af051/Gm/-ks--kopi-kenangan.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="Kopi Kenangan" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Kopi Kenangan was founded in 2017 by Mr Edward Tirtanata and his two friends.

This business is highly replicable. It is going very fast. If you take a long-term view, you can see that this business is worth a lot in five or 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So why won’t you invest in us while we are still very small? That’s how most start-ups pitch to venture capitalist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our business is simple enough and our numbers are very robust and strong. That’s why they decided to invest in Kopi Kenangan,” Mr Tirtanata said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12260996/16x9/320/180/c5de1164de3bf710be2b6aa73cc946ea/Qe/-ks--kopi-kenangan-customers.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12260996/16x9/360/203/c5de1164de3bf710be2b6aa73cc946ea/DC/-ks--kopi-kenangan-customers.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12260996/16x9/450/253/c5de1164de3bf710be2b6aa73cc946ea/TH/-ks--kopi-kenangan-customers.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12260996/16x9/550/309/c5de1164de3bf710be2b6aa73cc946ea/lS/-ks--kopi-kenangan-customers.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12260996/16x9/670/377/c5de1164de3bf710be2b6aa73cc946ea/vC/-ks--kopi-kenangan-customers.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12260996/16x9/768/432/c5de1164de3bf710be2b6aa73cc946ea/Eu/-ks--kopi-kenangan-customers.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12260996/16x9/991/557/c5de1164de3bf710be2b6aa73cc946ea/iM/-ks--kopi-kenangan-customers.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="Kopi Kenangan customers" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Ms Novi Febriani (left) and Ms Farah Fadila like Kopi Kenangan because of its affordable price.

Most of our friends just laughed at me when I said I wanted to ask for US$8 million … it was pretty cool,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the injection of the new funds, Kopi Kenangan opened more stores, grew its team and ventured into research and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June last year, Kopi Kenangan raised another US$20 million in Series A funding through Sequoia India, the investing firm that has backed Traveloka, Gojek and Tokopedia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, other venture capital firms watching Sequoia India closely also noticed Kopi Kenangan.

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;REUTERS: China's Baidu said on Friday (Jan 31) it was delaying the announcement of its fourth-quarter results and advised its employees in the country to work from home for a time period after the Lunar New Year holiday due to the recent outbreak of a new coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which postponed the announcement date by more than two weeks to Feb 27, said the revised date would give it more time to observe the business condition for the first quarter of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The virus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has spread across the world and prompted many companies to close stores and restrict travel to and from the country. The fast-spreading virus has killed over 200 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baidu, whose search engine dominates the market in China, said it now expects fourth-quarter revenue in a range of 28.3 billion yuan (3.1 billion pounds) to 28.9 billion yuan, compared with its previous forecast of 27.1 billion yuan to 28.7 billion yuan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Baidu were up about 5 per cent in extended trading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Wuhan coronavirus death toll rises to 259 in China with 46 new fatalities</title>

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;BEIJING: The number of confirmed deaths from China's coronavirus outbreak has risen to 259, as authorities in hardest-hit Hubei province on Saturday (Feb 1) reported 45 new fatalities. Another death was reported in Chongqing, bringing the total number of new deaths in the country to 46.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its daily update, the provincial health commission also said newly confirmed cases of infection in Hubei continued to grow at a steady pace, with 1,347. Nationwide there were 2,102 new cases as of Jan 31. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;That puts the national total at 11,791 as of Jan 31, according to the National Health Commission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-coronavirus-slow-response-12376008" target=_blank &gt;READ: Chinese official says slow response made virus epidemic worse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-slams-us-for-travel-warning-over-virus-12376254" target=_blank &gt;READ: China slams US for travel warning over virus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the country's deaths and overall cases have been in Hubei, a populous province in China's centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The top Communist Party official in Wuhan, the central city of 11 million people where the virus first emerged in December, on Friday expressed "remorse" because local authorities acted too slowly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus is believed to have emerged in December in the provincial capital of Wuhan in a meat market that sold wild game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, China's central government finally jumped into action, effectively sealing off Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province, and curbing travel across the nation of 1.4 billion people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the epidemic has spread far and wide as Chinese people travelled across the country and abroad over the Chinese New Year holiday that started last week.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a global health emergency, but said it was not recommending any international trade or travel restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has since ballooned into a global health emergency with cases in more than 20 countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countries have scrambled to evacuate their nationals from Wuhan, with hundreds of US, Japanese, British, French and South Korean citizens evacuated so far, and more countries planning airlifts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A flight carrying more than 300 Indian nationals left Wuhan in the early hours of Saturday for New Delhi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/americans-airlifted-china-placed-quarantine-12376426" target=_self &gt;200 US evacuees who landed in California&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday have been put under a rare mandatory quarantine order for 14 days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;US carriers American, United and Delta joined other airlines suspending flights to China, following the State Department travel advisory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Russia said it would evacuate more than 2,500 of its citizens holidaying on China's Hainan island, far from the epicentre of the outbreak, a day after sealing its remote far-eastern border.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;BEIJING: The coronavirus epidemic continued to wreak havoc on the international sporting calendar on Saturday (Feb 1) when the Lingshui China Masters badminton tournament, part of the qualifying process for the Tokyo Olympics, was postponed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizers made the decision to put off the event, which was scheduled to take place from Feb 25 to Mar 1 in Hainan, after a number of players withdrew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The Badminton World Federation (BWF) and Chinese Badminton Association (CBA) can confirm the decision to postpone the Lingshui China Masters 2020 ... in the wake of growing concerns over the coronavirus outbreak in China and surrounding areas," said a BWF statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"BWF and CBA have considered all necessary health, safety and logistical risks and both parties believe it is sensible to postpone the tournament at this time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/coronavirus-chaos-in-china-s-sporting-calendar--12370498" target=_self &gt;READ: Coronavirus chaos in China's sporting calendar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tournament was likely to be moved to a new date in May, the BWF added, but ranking points earned at the rescheduled event would no longer count towards Olympic qualification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The number of deaths from the coronavirus, which was first identified in Wuhan in China's Hubei Province, rose by 46 to 259 on Friday, the country's health authority said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BWF said it hoped the flagship Badminton Asia Championships (BAC) might still go ahead in Wuhan from Apr 21 to 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is ... too early at this time to make any final conclusions related to this event," the statement added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The 2020 Badminton Asia Championships falls within the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games qualification window and is one of the last opportunities for athletes to qualify for the Olympics Games."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The China Masters was the second event in Hainan to be affected by the epidemic this week after an elite women's international golf tournament, the Blue Bay LPGA, was cancelled on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IAAF world indoor athletics championships, which were due to be held in Nanjing from Mar 13 to 15, have been postponed until next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Olympic qualifiers impacted include a four-team women's soccer tournament involving China, Australia, Taiwan and Thailand, which was moved from Wuhan to Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The schedule had to be further reshuffled when the China team were placed in quarantine in Brisbane by Australian authorities until after Feb 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualifying tournaments in boxing and basketball for this year's Olympics were also moved from China, while other events have been cancelled or postponed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tokyo Olympics take place in the Japanese capital from Jul 24 to Aug 9.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus?cid=h3_referral_inarticlelinks_24082018_cna" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Commentary: Lucky to have flown out of Wuhan, but many feel mixture of concern and uncertainty</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.645301+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;LONDON: As our Boeing 747 from the Chinese city of Wuhan touched down at a military base in Oxfordshire on Friday (Jan 31) lunchtime, the overwhelming emotion was concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was no ordinary flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The passengers on board had been trapped in a city sealed off from the outside world, shut down by Chinese authorities struggling to get to grips with the coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 200 people and spread panic around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago I arrived in Wuhan to cover the virus outbreak for the Financial Times. But what started as a regular assignment quickly turned into a surreal captivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/coronavirus-koreans-evacuated-from-wuhan-12374476" target=_blank &gt;READ: Commentary: Coronavirus – Where should Koreans evacuated from Wuhan stay?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LUCKY TO BE EVACUATED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Friday, 110 people were allowed to leave by air as part of an evacuation effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my fellow passengers was an unaccompanied three-year-old girl who had been staying with her grandparents in Wuhan while her parents were in the UK.

When the call came, we only had a few hours to get to a meeting point near Wuhan airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like my fellow passengers I wore a face mask throughout most of the journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BITTERSWEET DEPARTURE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For other passengers, leaving the centre of the outbreak was mixed with uncertainty about the future and the lives they have left behind. “It’s bittersweet,” Emma Wang, a Chinese national travelling with her British partner and three-month-old baby, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I like living in Wuhan but the situation there is difficult for us, there’s a lot of sick people,” Dani Carmona, a Spaniard who had been working as a football coach in Wuhan, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://bit.ly/2S6PKqF" target=_blank &gt;LISTEN: Wuhan virus – The WHO, Singapore's infectious diseases authority and a global outbreak expert answer your burning questions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/wuhan-virus-social-media-communications-facebook-whatsapp-12364658" target=_blank &gt;READ: Commentary: Wuhan virus - when social media and chat groups complicate crisis communication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had to leave his girlfriend behind. “It was a difficult decision,” he said. “Of course, I will come back to Wuhan as soon as I can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cabin crew also wore masks and gloves during the 12-hour flight. One female attendant, who did not wish to be named, revealed that she would not earn extra money for the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I want to help people wherever they’re from,” she said. “We’re on three-month contracts, so it might have been possible to say ‘no’ to doing this flight, but it could have meant losing work in future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel it can’t be too dangerous, as the British government wouldn’t put us at risk,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NO CERTAINTY FOR THOSE LEFT IN WUHAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we neared the UK, a Foreign Office official told us that the flight was “nothing short of remarkable” given the logistical issues, including “obstacles thrown by Beijing”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we landed there was no clapping or cheering from the passengers, who included 27 EU nationals as well as pilots and a Spanish crew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12368462/16x9/320/180/f70cbb80c488c4c87f74da9b747e59f8/Hr/an-aircraft-chartered-by-the-u-s--state-department-to-evacuate-government-employees-from-the-novel-coronavirus-threat-in-the-chinese-city-of-wuhan--arrives-at-ted-stevens-anchorage-international-airpo-3.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12368462/16x9/360/203/f70cbb80c488c4c87f74da9b747e59f8/uP/an-aircraft-chartered-by-the-u-s--state-department-to-evacuate-government-employees-from-the-novel-coronavirus-threat-in-the-chinese-city-of-wuhan--arrives-at-ted-stevens-anchorage-international-airpo-3.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12368462/16x9/450/253/f70cbb80c488c4c87f74da9b747e59f8/Wk/an-aircraft-chartered-by-the-u-s--state-department-to-evacuate-government-employees-from-the-novel-coronavirus-threat-in-the-chinese-city-of-wuhan--arrives-at-ted-stevens-anchorage-international-airpo-3.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12368462/16x9/550/309/f70cbb80c488c4c87f74da9b747e59f8/wP/an-aircraft-chartered-by-the-u-s--state-department-to-evacuate-government-employees-from-the-novel-coronavirus-threat-in-the-chinese-city-of-wuhan--arrives-at-ted-stevens-anchorage-international-airpo-3.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12368462/16x9/670/377/f70cbb80c488c4c87f74da9b747e59f8/Zj/an-aircraft-chartered-by-the-u-s--state-department-to-evacuate-government-employees-from-the-novel-coronavirus-threat-in-the-chinese-city-of-wuhan--arrives-at-ted-stevens-anchorage-international-airpo-3.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12368462/16x9/768/432/f70cbb80c488c4c87f74da9b747e59f8/jb/an-aircraft-chartered-by-the-u-s--state-department-to-evacuate-government-employees-from-the-novel-coronavirus-threat-in-the-chinese-city-of-wuhan--arrives-at-ted-stevens-anchorage-international-airpo-3.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12368462/16x9/991/557/f70cbb80c488c4c87f74da9b747e59f8/bh/an-aircraft-chartered-by-the-u-s--state-department-to-evacuate-government-employees-from-the-novel-coronavirus-threat-in-the-chinese-city-of-wuhan--arrives-at-ted-stevens-anchorage-international-airpo-3.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="An aircraft chartered by the U.S. State Department to evacuate government employees from the novel " class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; An aircraft chartered by the U.S. State Department to evacuate government employees from the novel coronavirus threat in the Chinese city of Wuhan, arrives at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport.

    <title>Chinese tourists desert Thai resort as Wuhan coronavirus spreads</title>

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;PHUKET, Thailand: The narrow laneways and pastel-coloured shophouses of Phuket Old Town are usually bustling with Chinese tourists during the Lunar New Year holiday, but travel bans and local fears about coronavirus have largely emptied the streets this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a handful of tourists, many wearing face masks, strolled through the area during daylight hours this week. In the evening, foot traffic increased a little under the glow of the red lanterns strung across the thoroughfare, but remained far below normal levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The impact is tremendous," 45-year old Ausana Akaradachakul told Reuters as she waited behind the counter for shoppers in her store selling postcards, straw bags, clothing and jewellery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Only a few days after the news broke about the virus, the Chinese tourists were visibly few," Akaradachakul said. "I think about 70per cent of them are gone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12378026/16x9/320/180/7e4c263cf6698b24033fc75469a299e1/kF/people-wearing-protective-face-maks-are-seen-at-a-walking-street-in-phuket-3.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12378026/16x9/360/203/7e4c263cf6698b24033fc75469a299e1/Wd/people-wearing-protective-face-maks-are-seen-at-a-walking-street-in-phuket-3.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12378026/16x9/450/253/7e4c263cf6698b24033fc75469a299e1/tG/people-wearing-protective-face-maks-are-seen-at-a-walking-street-in-phuket-3.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12378026/16x9/550/309/7e4c263cf6698b24033fc75469a299e1/uV/people-wearing-protective-face-maks-are-seen-at-a-walking-street-in-phuket-3.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12378026/16x9/670/377/7e4c263cf6698b24033fc75469a299e1/th/people-wearing-protective-face-maks-are-seen-at-a-walking-street-in-phuket-3.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12378026/16x9/768/432/7e4c263cf6698b24033fc75469a299e1/DZ/people-wearing-protective-face-maks-are-seen-at-a-walking-street-in-phuket-3.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12378026/16x9/991/557/7e4c263cf6698b24033fc75469a299e1/zv/people-wearing-protective-face-maks-are-seen-at-a-walking-street-in-phuket-3.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="People wearing protective face maks are seen at a walking street in Phuket" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; People wearing protective face maks are seen at a walking street in Phuket.

    <title>Apple to shut down all official stores in Chinese mainland due to Wuhan coronavirus outbreak</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.645156+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK: Apple on Saturday (Feb 1) said it has decided to shut down all of its official stores in mainland China until Feb 9, as fears over the &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/wuhan-virus-death-toll-rises-china-cases-12376694" target=_blank &gt;Wuhan coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt; mounted and the death toll more than doubled to over 250 from a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Out of an abundance of caution and based on the latest advice from leading health experts, we're closing all our corporate offices, stores, and contact centers in mainland China through Feb 9," Apple said in a statement. The company said looked forward to re-opening stores "as soon as possible".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/wuhan-coronavirus-slow-response-12376008" target=_blank &gt;READ: Chinese official says slow response made virus epidemic worse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/china-slams-us-for-travel-warning-over-virus-12376254" target=_blank &gt;READ: China slams US for travel warning over virus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Apple closed three stores in China due to concerns about the spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's joining a handful of overseas retailers, including Starbucks and McDonald's to temporarily shut storefronts as a precautionary measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many other companies, meanwhile, have called for employees in China to work from home and cease non-essential business travel in the first week of February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, businesses in China would be preparing to return to normal operations following the end of the week-long Chinese New Year Holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/faq-wuhan-coronavirus-and-its-outbreak-12373466" target=_blank &gt;FAQ: Wuhan coronavirus and its outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/wuhan-virus-hospital-capacity-coronavirus-12348902" target=_blank &gt;READ: In one Wuhan hospital, long lines, fear and frustration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple remains heavily reliant on China both for smartphone sales as well as for its supply chain and manufacturing. Many factories in Hubei province, including plants run by AB InBev and General Motors, have temporarily suspended production due to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company was working out mitigation plans to deal with possible production loss from its suppliers in Wuhan. The city where the virus outbreak originated is home to several Apple suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;​​​​​​​&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;JAKARTA: A Batik Air flight departed from Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta International airport on Saturday (Feb 1) to Wuhan, China to evacuate 245 Indonesians who are trapped in Hubei province, the Indonesian government said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are 245 Indonesians in Hubei, mostly in Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, and once they have returned they will be quarantined in the Natuna Islands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Indonesians are all in good condition, foreign minister Retno Marsudi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've been communicating with them since last night and I've received reports that they are healthy and happy to return home," Mdm Marsudi said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/wuhan-virus-coronavirus-spain-first-case-12377104" target=_blank &gt;READ: Spain confirms first case of Wuhan coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-indonesia-china-industrial-plant-thousands-lockdown-12374346" target=_blank &gt;READ: Thousands on virus lockdown at China-backed plant in Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health minister Terawan Agus Putranto said that the Indonesians have been screened according to WHO protocols. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have already screened and cleared them. The ones we are going to carry back home are healthy Indonesians citizens," Mr Putranto said. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 250 Indonesians, including evacuation personnel, are expected to arrive in Indonesia on Sunday and they will then be quarantined in Natuna, military chief Hadi Tjahjanto said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The military supports the return (of the citizens) from Wuhan to Indonesia by providing facilities and infrastructure in accordance to health protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a place of isolation far from the population, and the best and chosen place is Natuna," military chief Hadi Tjahjanto said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that Natuna was chosen because it is a military base and is equipped with a hospital run by the military.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So there are doctors from the army, navy, and air force. It also has a runway which is near to the isolation (quarantine) place," he added. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Batik Air flight is also carrying masks and surgical units to be handed to the government of China, Mdm Marsudi said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move to evacuate the Indonesians comes after Mdm Marsudi said on Friday that &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-indonesia-charter-planes-hubei-china-coronavirus-12374170" target=_blank &gt;China had cleared planes to fly&lt;/a&gt; to the virus-hit Chinese province of Hubei to evacuate Indonesian citizens from the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-coronavirus-evacuated-flight-quarantine-experience-12377328" target=_blank &gt;READ: Commentary: Lucky to have flown out of Wuhan, but many feel mixture of concern and uncertainty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/natuna-china-indonesia-standoff-vessels-leave-12247302" target=_blank &gt;READ: Chinese vessels leaving Natuna after days of stand-off with Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 11,000 cases of the Wuhan coronavirus have been confirmed since it emerged late December in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus has reached to more than 20 countries with more than 100 cases outside of China, but Indonesia has yet to report its first case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indonesia has tested several individuals suspected of having contracted the coronavirus but as of Saturday all have been declared negative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus?cid=h3_referral_inarticlelinks_24082018_cna?cid=h3_referral_inarticlelinks_24082018_cna" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;SYDNEY: The Australian government on Saturday (Feb 1) said it would bar non-citizens arriving from mainland China from entering the country under new measures to combat the spread of the &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/wuhan-virus-death-toll-rises-china-cases-12376694" target=_blank &gt;Wuhan coronavirus epidemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Scott Morrison said only "Australian citizens, Australian residents, dependents, legal guardians or spouses" would be permitted into the country from mainland China from Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/wuhan-virus-who-international-emergency-declare-12372372" target=_blank &gt;READ: WHO declares international emergency over Wuhan virus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/faq-wuhan-coronavirus-and-its-outbreak-12373466" target=_blank &gt;FAQ: Wuhan coronavirus and its outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The arrangements are being put in place through our border authorities to ensure that that can be actioned," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Border control authorities would be able to "step up" processes in the next 24 hours to screen those who had departed or transited through China, Morrison said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We're in fact operating with an abundance of caution in these circumstances. So Australians can go about their daily lives with confidence," Morrison told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're acting here in advance of many countries in terms of when similar types of arrangements are being put in place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-embed-social--youtube  data-css=c-embed-social &gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder=0  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ke-APxblfio" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The requirement of people arriving in Australia from Hubei province to "self-isolate" for 14 days was expanded from Saturday to include anyone travelling from mainland China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia's foreign ministry also updated its travel advice for China to "do not travel".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qantas Airways, Australia's flag carrier, said earlier Saturday it would &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/wuhan-coronavirus-qantas-suspends-direct-flights-to-china-12377812" target=_blank &gt;suspend its two direct flights to mainland China&lt;/a&gt; - Sydney to Beijing and Shanghai - from Feb 9 because of various virus-linked international restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air New Zealand followed suit, announcing a suspension of its Auckland-Shanghai service from Feb 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://cna.asia/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;BEIJING: China has asked couples to delay their nuptials from a popular wedding date and families to scale down funeral services to help slow the spread of the country's viral outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appeal came as the death toll from the new coronavirus &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-death-toll-rises-china-cases-12376694" target=_blank &gt;soared to 259&lt;/a&gt; and the total number of cases neared 12,000 nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Where marriage registrations have been announced or promised for Feb 2 this year, you are advised to cancel it and explain the situation to others," a civil affairs ministry statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-flies-citizens-home-to-virus-hit-wuhan-12378978" target=_blank &gt;READ: China flies citizens home to virus-hit Wuhan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-apple-shut-all-official-stores-mainland-china-feb-12379146" target=_blank &gt;READ: Apple to shut down all official stores in Chinese mainland due to Wuhan coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feb 2 this year is being considered a lucky date for wedding ceremonies because the sequence of numbers "02022020" reads the same backwards as forwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beijing, Shanghai and other cities had earlier decided to offer wedding registry services on the date, despite it falling on a Sunday (Feb 2) when offices are usually closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry said it would temporarily halt marriage counselling services and asked the public not to hold wedding banquets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also said funerals should be held in a "simple and expeditious manner to avoid gatherings of people" and the bodies of any victims of the coronavirus should be cremated as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staff handling funerals should wear protective gear and carry out temperature checks to avoid risking infection, the statement added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has introduced drastic travel restrictions and pushed back the end of the Chinese New Year break - when hundreds of millions of people travel across the country to visit family - in a bid to contain the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/faq-wuhan-coronavirus-and-its-outbreak-12373466" target=_blank &gt;FAQ: Wuhan coronavirus and its outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-hospital-capacity-coronavirus-12348902" target=_blank &gt;READ: In one Wuhan hospital, long lines, fear and frustration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schools and universities nationwide have been told not to resume classes, officials have urged factories to delay their return to work and the public has been asked to avoid large crowds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 50 million people in Hubei province, where the virus was first detected, are effectively locked down after authorities severed transport links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials in Hubei announced Saturday that they would suspend all marriage registrations from Monday until further notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several countries including the US and Australia have barred entry to foreigners who have travelled to China in the past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://cna.asia/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

The country has cancelled most flights to China, imposed mandatory quarantine on all arrivals from China, and heavily restricted border crossings following the outbreak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

We have no choice," Yu added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The HAEA will meet with representatives from their employer - the city's hospital authority - on Sunday to negotiate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The newly formed alliance said 9,000 of its members back the strike, making up 10 per cent of the workforce of the city's workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If no deal is reached, around 30 per cent of the 9,000 - those who work in non-essential positions - would first go on strike next Monday.

    <title>Malaysia probes allegations that Airbus bribed AirAsia bosses</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.644705+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's anti-graft agency is investigating allegations by Britain's Serious Fraud Office that Airbus paid a bribe of US$50 million to win plane orders from Asia’s largest budget airline group, Malaysia-based AirAsia, it said on Saturday (Feb 1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SFO said on Friday that Airbus had failed to prevent individuals associated with it bribing executives linked to AirAsia Group and its long-haul arm, AirAsia X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;AirAsia said it had never made any purchase decisions that were premised on an Airbus sponsorship, and that it would fully cooperate with Malaysia's Anti-Corruption Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, it said it had not been involved with the SFO’s investigation of Airbus or given any opportunity to provide clarification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"AirAsia vigorously rejects and denies any and all allegations of wrongdoing," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As AirAsia and its executives have no visibility on Airbus’ internal processes, we cannot comment on or be associated with any alleged failures or lapses on the part of Airbus to comply with its own policies or applicable legal requirements."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Airbus declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Airbus agreed a record US$4 billion settlement with France, Britain and the United States after prosecutors said it had bribed public officials and hidden the payments as part of a pattern of worldwide corruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal allowed Airbus to avoid criminal prosecution that could have led to it being barred from public contracts in the United States and the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disclosures came after an investigation spanning sales to more than a dozen overseas markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Under the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Act we are empowered, and have jurisdiction, to investigate any act of corruption committed by any Malaysian citizen or permanent resident in any place outside Malaysia," MACC Chief Commissioner Latheefa Koya said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the case of the Airbus-AirAsia disclosures, I confirm that the MACC is in touch with the UK authorities and is already investigating the matter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MALAYSIA AIRLINES SEEKS PARTNER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation comes as the Malaysian government evaluates five strategic investment proposals, among them one from AirAsia, to partner with the ailing national carrier, Malaysia Airlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AirAsia runs an all-Airbus fleet of 274 planes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SFO's allegations concern a 2012 sponsorship agreement between the now-defunct Caterham Formula 1 racing team, founded by AirAsia boss Tony Fernandes, and Airbus's then-parent, EADS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SFO said on Friday that between October 2013 and January 2015, EADS paid US$50 million to sponsor Caterham, which was jointly owned by two people described as AirAsia Executive 1 and Executive 2. It said Airbus employees offered an additional US$55 million, though no payment was made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fernandes bought Caterham together with his partner Kamarudin Meranun, AirAsia's chairman, in 2011. Fernandes and Kamarudin could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SFO said that Executives 1 and 2 were "key decision makers in AirAsia and AirAsia X, and were rewarded in respect of the order of 180 aircraft from Airbus".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"The payments to the sports team were intended to secure or reward improper favour by them in respect of that business."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The airline's statement said that "all negotiations and dealings leading to the signing of any aircraft purchase agreement have been undertaken directly with Airbus on an arm’s length basis, and without the involvement of any third parties or intermediaries".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Malaysia has been trying for years to recover billions of dollars allegedly stolen from the state fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Canberra heatwave breaks records amid wildfire threat</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.644668+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;SYDNEY: Temperatures in the Australian capital Canberra have set a new monthly record amid an advancing wildfire that has prompted a state of emergency declaration, weather service Meteo France said Sunday (Feb 2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city declared its first state of emergency in nearly two decades last week in anticipation of a heatwave and predictions that fires could hit the southern suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Saturday, temperatures in Canberra hit 42.7 degrees Celsius (108.9 degrees Fahrenheit), an all-time high for February that broke a record of 42.2 degrees Celsius (108 degrees Fahrenheit) set in 1968, Meteo France weather forecaster Etienne Kapikian said on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That temperature was also the third-highest recorded in the city in any month, Kapikian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new record along with all-time highs in January and December make the 2019-2020 summer the hottest on record, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia's Bureau of Meteorology did not immediately confirm the records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The state of emergency declared on Thursday is the first in the Australian Capital Territory, which includes Canberra and some surrounding townships, since 2003, when fires destroyed almost 500 homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main threat comes from the Orroral Valley fire, which has burned around 18,000 hectares (45,000 acres) of mostly remote bushland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities say the searing heat, accompanied by dry winds, could bring severe bushfire conditions to parts of New South Wales and Victoria. More than 80 fires are still burning across the two states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temperatures in the New South Wales town of Richmond climbed to 46.8 degrees Celsius (116.2 degrees Fahrenheit) on Saturday, Kapikian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storms are forecast to follow the heatwave, bringing rain that could help dampen fires but also carry the potential for wild weather, including flash flooding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extreme weather has battered parts of Australia in recent weeks, bringing giant hail, floods and landslides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 33 people have died and vast swaths of the country have been burned since September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The months-long crisis has sparked renewed calls for Australia's conservative government to take immediate action on climate change, with street protests urging Prime Minister Scott Morrison to reduce the country's reliance on coal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists say the bushfire disaster was likely exacerbated by climate change, coming on the back of a crippling drought that turned forests into a tinderbox and allowed blazes to spread out of control quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>7-year-old Thai artist unleashes imagination through colourful fabric</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.644630+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;TRANG, Thailand: When Typhoon Mangkhut hit southern Thailand two years ago, six-year-old Winny saw it differently from most people in her country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her tropical cyclone was purple, like the colour of a mangosteen or “mangkhut” in the local language. Its blustery force tore through her peaceful hometown of Trang unleashing colourful chaos. Local homes in pink and white all bore the brunt of the angry storm. Torrential rains brought blue floods to the streets, where the yellow lights of lampposts shone bright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Keziah ‘Winny’ Chumpuang captured the whole experience on canvas. Her vivid memory sharpened by rich imagination created a vibrant palette of “Typhoon Mangkhut” – an abstract acrylic painting that has recently made its way onto linen under a new business label, Keziah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the latest achievement of Winny, now seven, making her one of the youngest entrepreneurs in Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-picture--article is-original" data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;img alt="Typhoon Mangkhut" class="picture__image lazyload" data-src="/image/12311876/0x0/3008/2008/731a010f8c85cba94f8fe70136de6a07/km/typhoon-mangkhut.jpg"/&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Typhoon Mangkhut, an abstract painting by seven-year-old Keziah Chumpuang. (Photo: Pichayada Promchertchoo)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;In just four months since its launch last October, Keziah has already brought the Chumpuangs more than US$3,000 dollars. Its Facebook page is fast gaining followers, currently counting more than 2,500. And orders keep coming in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“(The sale) is very good; mama doesn’t get to sleep,” Winny said with a big laugh. “Right now, we’re running out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-embed-social--youtube  data-css=c-embed-social &gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder=0  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-K2128cPgi0" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keziah is all about printed linen. What sets it apart from others is the unique patterns taken from Winny’s abstract paintings. Each tells its own story, from a tropical cyclone to a mysterious snow forest and a rainbow fishnet. Together, they offer a fascinating glimpse into her colourful life and the big imagination that defines it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-picture--article is-original" data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;img alt="Keziah 'Winny' Chumpuang" class="picture__image lazyload" data-src="/image/12311830/0x0/3008/2008/f67f8f460c7a56adb97cef857957bf67/hI/keziah--winny--chumpuang-2.jpg"/&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Keziah 'Winny' Chumpuang is gaining popularity in Thailand as one of its youngest entrepreneurs and abstract artists. Her paintings are vibrant and portray what she has experienced in her hometown Trang and beyond. (Photo: Pichayada Promchertchoo) &lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides painting, Winny also loves fashion. She likes posing for photos and dreams of becoming a supermodel. One day, she decided she wanted to wear her own art, not knowing her request would soon pave the way for a thriving business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I told mama I wanted a skirt with my painting on it. So mama looked for a factory but nobody agreed to do it. Eventually, we found the factory of Uncle Max. This is the first pattern to get printed,” she told CNA, pointing at her painting “A Snow Forest”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The picture is her portrayal of a dark wood covered in snow – something she has never seen in real life. Probably unrecognisable by others, it shows luminescent fireflies amid thick layers of dark green trees. Some of them drop their saliva, she said, glittering red and yellow spots among blueberries and white snow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-picture--article is-original" data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;img alt="A Snow Forest" class="picture__image lazyload" data-src="/image/12312002/0x0/2750/1836/41b4c7288c826ab1d26659c43dc5c255/NV/a-snow-forest.jpg"/&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; A Snow Forest is one of the first paintings by Keziah 'Winny' Chumpuang to get printed on linen and turned into clothes. (Photo: Pichayada Promchertchoo)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is inside the mysterious Amazon forest. It snows there because this is a wintry land,” the young artist said with a big smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I saw a picture of a snow forest and wanted to paint it because it doesn’t exist in Thailand. We’ve only got rain,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides “A Snow Forest”, Winny also had a few of her other paintings screened on linen and ended up with a lot of printed fabric at home. Not knowing what to do with it all, the family decided to sell it under the label Keziah. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-picture--article is-original" data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;img alt="Keziah Chumpuang" class="picture__image lazyload" data-src="/image/12311848/0x0/2966/1980/5aaf969ff22a1fef4fba97844217eea0/WT/keziah--winny--chumpuang--1-.jpg"/&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Keziah 'Winny' Chumpuang poses with her clothes. The patterns are taken from her own acrylic paintings. (Photo: Pichayada Promchertchoo) &lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The product was showcased at one of the leading international trade fairs in Thailand last year – Style Bangkok. Winny was the youngest entrepreneur to participate and all the linen featuring her artworks was sold out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Her art is her happiness, her love and her identity. For our family, this is the most important thing about art. We don’t focus on the business or the brand. They’re just by-products of joy and love in our family,” said her mother, Yupawan Yongpu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ART – IDENTITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winny became interested in art when she was three. Her biggest inspiration was eight-year-old watercolour artist Wajana ‘Hero’ Chumpuang, her brother. He is well-known in the art circle in Trang. Some of his works have been auctioned and a few others have been on display at art events in Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the siblings have created more than 1,000 artworks. Many of them are filling up their home – on the walls, different floors and easels. Yet, one can tell a clear distinction between their styles. Hero’s subjects are recognisable. Winny’s are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-picture--article is-original" data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;img alt="Wajana 'Hero' Chumpuang" class="picture__image lazyload" data-src="/image/12311838/0x0/3008/2008/d17752700354e6e8f4d5b1a67765057c/vA/wajana--hero--chumpuang.jpg"/&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Eight-year-old Wajana Chumpuang plays with a skateboard inside his house. Behind him, his paintings depict different scenes of nature. (Photo: Pichayada Promchertchoo)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hero became interested in watercolour at the age of two. Winny tried it too but it wasn’t her style. Her flowers aren’t flowers and her trees aren’t trees. She likes art but just didn’t know how to begin,” their mother said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yupawan and her husband are both lawyers. Neither of them can paint or know much about art, let alone abstract painting. But when the couple brought their children to an art workshop a few years ago, they got to discover a hidden talent in their little girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the National Artists Tour project in Krabi, which Hero was invited to join. While her brother painted with other children, Winny played by herself on a spare canvas nearby. Her picture was colourful but unrecognisable. It depicted, according to her, the Garden of Eden, with an unusual-looking tree bearing “a special fruit that knows what is good and what is bad”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-picture--article is-original" data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;img alt="Winny's printed linen" class="picture__image lazyload" data-src="/image/12311882/0x0/3008/2008/862af051b9a255047f500e83786d6f1f/Mm/winny-s-printed-linen.jpg"/&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Winny's business focuses on printed linen featuring her own abstract artworks. (Photo: Pichayada Promchertchoo)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as it turned out, her painting won silver and Hero’s won gold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were so puzzled they announced her name, ‘Keziah Chumpuang, Kindergarten 3’,” Yupawan said. Her husband, she added, went to ask one of the judging artists why their daughter won the award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The artist said Winny had freedom. That’s what he wanted to see in the workshop – freedom – not portraits, beautiful paintings, or by-products of some rigorous training."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that was when Yupawan and her husband first heard about abstract art. For their young daughter, the silver medal and recognition ignited a passion in her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-picture--article is-original" data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;img alt=Winny  class="picture__image lazyload" data-src="/image/12311908/0x0/2631/1756/f47eb858283c52d8d82c2e19cf3a88d9/Th/winny.jpg"/&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; "I didn’t know what a silver medal was," Winny said. (Photo: Pichayada Promchertchoo) &lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fire in her was lit. She was so proud,” Yupawan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Papa bought her paints and canvases, and she just kept painting and creating artworks that are filling up the house. She started to have her identity, transforming from a child who always walked behind Hero – the younger sister.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘THINK, PLAY AND CREATE’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The siblings’ artistic skills are gaining more popularity in Thailand. Many of their fans call them geniuses. But to their parents, they are simply children who have space to do what they love. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their early paintings were not perfect. But regular practice has helped develop their skills and firm support from their parents has made them confident to express themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These two children simply have space to think, play and create,” said their father Kornkamol Chumpuang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-picture--article is-original" data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;img alt="Rice fields by Wajana Chumpuang" class="picture__image lazyload" data-src="/image/12311894/0x0/2830/1889/4d94f3b3a9e563ef7f71299f408baefe/Ho/paints.jpg"/&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Pictures of rice fields at different times of the day by Wajana 'Hero' Chumpuang, 8. (Photo: Pichayada Promchertchoo)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re not experts in raising children but we know we love them. Our love makes us want to listen to them, to read into their mind and learn what they want to say, and give them space for that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Chumpuangs, time is the most valuable asset in the family. Despite their busy work schedule, the couple make sure they have the evening and weekends free for their children. They play with them, listen to their stories, and bring them to different places where they can be with nature and enjoy outdoor activities instead of video games or social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-picture--article is-original" data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;img alt="Keziah in her house in Trang" class="picture__image lazyload" data-src="/image/12311914/0x0/2881/1923/5c4cab58a7f9920d85281e563f7d1e78/ph/keziah--winny--chumpuang--2-.jpg"/&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Since winning a silver medal at an art workshop in Krabi, Keziah Chumpuang has painted about 300 abstract artworks with acrylic. (Photo: Pichayada Promchertchoo)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is shown in their children’s paintings. Despite their different styles, both Hero and Winny share their love for nature on the canvas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I like painting the sea and, sometimes, forests. I don’t like painting cities – they hurt animals,” said Hero, sitting on his new skateboard in the living room. Behind him, rows of paintings show beautiful rice fields, a wetland before sunset, blooming flowers in a garden and birds in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearby, Winny’s acrylic painting “Carp” was propped against an easel. There are 25 carp in the picture, she said, and they are all eating “dry human food”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I saw carp in a pond and wanted to paint them. They have many colours – yellow, red and black. It was night time then, so they had to turn on the white light. That’s why the water is invisible,” she said, pointing at the colourful shapes on the canvas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-picture--article is-original" data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;img alt=Carp  class="picture__image lazyload" data-src="/image/12311862/0x0/3008/2008/956dd4bc0a0a49ff31bbf8e511598e90/jA/carp.jpg"/&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Carp, an acrylic painting by Keziah Chumpuang. (Photo: Pichayada Promchertchoo)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Chumpuangs, art is a great mode of communication. Winny and Hero often tell their parents the stories behind their brushstrokes. Subjects can be as simple as a crispy pancake they got to eat or meaningful thoughts they have processed and conveyed through pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Of course, children can’t communicate as well as adults. We can write, talk and be understood. Still, children have their own way to tell society how they feel about this world or what they want to see,” their father said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our children do so through artworks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Commentary: Macau, China’s other One Country, Two Systems model, seems to be working just fine</title>

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE: In December 2019, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Macau to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its return to China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Xi lauded the former Portuguese colony’s achievements and progress, declaring that the island’s transformation since its return to the motherland highlighted the “viability and strength” of the “One Country, Two Systems” model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;A constitutional framework established by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in the early 1980s, the One Country, Two Systems model aims to provide political coverage for the peaceful return of colonial territories, namely Hong Kong and Macau, to China and space for adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/china-hong-kong-macau-xi-jinping-foreign-forces-12199894" target=_self &gt;READ: China won't allow foreign forces to interfere in Hong Kong, Macau: Xi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Special Administrative Regions, Hong Kong and Macau would retain a high degree of autonomy, holding executive, legislative and judicial powers, but accept China’s sovereignty over matters such as foreign affairs and defence, for 50 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Macau, the chief executive is chosen by a 400-strong committee comprising of business, political and societal leaders, approved by Beijing – a similar arrangement to Hong Kong’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE HONG KONG PROTESTS AND MACAU&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the Hong Kong protests since June 2019 have brought into sharper focus questions about this model of governance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What began as a protest against a proposed law that could allow extradition to China soon ballooned into mass demonstrations and a wider call for other political freedoms, which many Hong Kongers see as their unique core values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/hong-kong-protests-one-country-two-systems-fail-inequality-12105978" target=_self &gt;READ: Commentary: This may be the end of Hong Kong as we know it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting violence has been unprecedented.

But observers have also pointed to Hong Kong’s housing, employment and inequality woes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In sharp contrast, Macau has been lauded for its political stability and economic prosperity. It has escaped rather unscathed by the political divisions that have rocked Hong Kong, even though Macau is merely a one-hour ferry away ride from Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MACAU THE ECONOMIC GATEWAY TO PORTUGESE SPEAKING WORLD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before its handover in 1999 to mainland China, Macau attempted to maintain strong socioeconomic ties with the Mainland, and sustain its local economy by leveraging its role as a gateway for China to the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, based on its historical, cultural and economic links with Portugal, Macau is keen to act as a bridge between China and Portuguese-speaking countries in Europe, Africa and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a maritime hub for trade between China, Southeast Asia and Europe along the Silk Road, Macau sees a role for itself in boosting commercial and trade between China and Portuguese-speaking nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/china-pearl-river-delta-boost-with-hong-kong-macau-zhuhai-bridge-10891320" target=_self &gt;READ: Commentary: China dreams big with the world's longest sea bridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It therefore established a permanent secretariat to staff the Forum for Economic and Trade Cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries formed in 2003, to drive economic, commercial, cultural and educational exchanges among members, with a ministerial conference to take stock of progress every three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through such platforms and other exchanges, Macau has played a critical interlocutor role, aiding Chinese firms to gain wider access to Portugal and other Portuguese-speaking markets in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MACAU’S ECONOMY IS POWERING ON&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macau’s rapid economic growth since the 1999 handover owes in large part to the various supportive policies by Beijing, including pro-gaming policies that have transformed the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/7661178/16x9/320/180/860926ba66d0a72e59105bfb07bd455f/WS/china-is-reportedly-to-hakve-the-cash-machine-limit-for-certain-cardholders-visiting-the-gambling---3355022.png 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/7661178/16x9/360/203/860926ba66d0a72e59105bfb07bd455f/Iq/china-is-reportedly-to-hakve-the-cash-machine-limit-for-certain-cardholders-visiting-the-gambling---3355022.png 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/7661178/16x9/450/253/860926ba66d0a72e59105bfb07bd455f/nT/china-is-reportedly-to-hakve-the-cash-machine-limit-for-certain-cardholders-visiting-the-gambling---3355022.png 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/7661178/16x9/550/309/860926ba66d0a72e59105bfb07bd455f/Yi/china-is-reportedly-to-hakve-the-cash-machine-limit-for-certain-cardholders-visiting-the-gambling---3355022.png 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/7661178/16x9/670/377/860926ba66d0a72e59105bfb07bd455f/Pu/china-is-reportedly-to-hakve-the-cash-machine-limit-for-certain-cardholders-visiting-the-gambling---3355022.png 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/7661178/16x9/768/432/860926ba66d0a72e59105bfb07bd455f/SC/china-is-reportedly-to-hakve-the-cash-machine-limit-for-certain-cardholders-visiting-the-gambling---3355022.png 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/7661178/16x9/991/557/860926ba66d0a72e59105bfb07bd455f/Xk/china-is-reportedly-to-hakve-the-cash-machine-limit-for-certain-cardholders-visiting-the-gambling---3355022.png 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="China is reportedly to hakve the cash machine limit for certain cardholders visiting the gambling" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; A view of Macau.

(File photo: REUTERS/Jason Lee)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thorny issue of high youth unemployment in Hong Kong has not arisen in Macau, where the unemployment rate is low – 1.7 per cent as of November 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Hong Kong’s unrest has seen the unemployment rate creep upwards to 3.1 per cent in October 2019, with sector-specific unemployment hitting all-time highs: 5 per cent in retail, accommodation and food services combined, and 6.1 per cent in the food and beverage sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the housing unaffordability crisis afflicting Hong Kong has no parallels in Macau. Macau residents enjoy generous social welfare programmes often in form of cash hand-outs. Since 2008, all permanent residents receive a dividend from the Macau government every year.

Hear what Taiwanese themselves say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it is enjoying economic success for now, Macau’s casino-dominated economic development is fragile and not sustainable in the long-run perspective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No doubt Macau will have to restructure and diversify its economy beyond gambling, which contributes to 80 per cent of government revenue and half its GDP, if it intends to achieve greater resilience and sustainability for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourists too have been a cause for concern in recent years. Total visitor arrivals outstripped the size of the population by 53 times higher last year, owing to the rapid increase in tourist arrivals from mainland China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/china-tourists-curbs-foreign-policy-tool-11934272" target=_self &gt;READ: Commentary: Is China using tourists to extend its overseas influence?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This diversification of its casino-dominated economy will be a challenging task given Macau’s small size, shortage of land and lack of human talent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But whether Macau, a small region of only 31 sq km in size, can sway Taiwan’s calculus, relative to Hong Kong, is questionable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yu Hong is a Senior Research Fellow at the East Asian Institute, National University of Singapore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Commentary: China in a Wuhan coronavirus lockdown – life is normal but not really</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.644556+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;BEIJING: On the eve of Chinese New Year, I set off from Beijing for my grandparents’ home in northern China. It is the day after the city of Wuhan has in effect been placed under quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am headed some 600km from Wuhan, but this New Year holiday is very different: Almost everyone on the train from Beijing is wearing a face mask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/wuhan-virus-masks-singapore-false-sense-security-experts-12370522" target=_self &gt;READ: Masks may offer 'false sense of security' against Wuhan virus, say medical experts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I take mine off when I arrive at my grandparents’ crowded flat, where they, along with a total of seven aunts, uncles and cousins, are already folding dumplings for the pot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are chatting about the virus outbreak, but the mood is still calm. Everyone is busy dealing with a more immediate concern: Making dinner for a large family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRAVELLING THROUGH LOCKDOWN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far, only Wuhan has taken city-wide preventive measures, but we are now discussing our own. To some relief, my grandparents announce they are cancelling our usual visits to relatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like me, some travellers managed to reach home before transport links started shutting down, and are at least holed up with loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for late travellers, those who cancelled travel plans out of fear of contagion and transport disruption, let alone the 9 million people stuck in Wuhan, the situation is far worse.

Go back one or two generations, and most people’s families were subsistence farmers living in the countryside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past 50 years, a vast rural-urban migration has spread those families across the country. Those who are lucky enough to go to university often settle down in the big cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and smaller provincial capitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who don’t settle in the cities go everywhere as migrant workers fuelling the low-paid casual labour of China’s economic development. Because the government makes it very difficult for migrant workers to access education in the cities, many leave their children with relatives in the countryside, and visit them at New Year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/wuhan-virus-how-prepared-your-company-work-flexible-continuity-12369936" target=_self &gt;READ: Commentary: Wuhan virus – how prepared is your company? What gets green, amber and red rankings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Chinese New Year is a crucial annual migration that is easier for some than for others. Rail tickets sell out quickly, and those with the money might buy plane tickets instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many migrant workers travel by long-distance bus – the same services that multiple provinces have since suspended in the wake of the virus outbreak. One of my father’s cousins drives for three days or more, covering 4,000km each way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the first day of the holiday, we make plans to visit my grandparents’ old farmstead the next day, to sweep my great-grandma’s grave and light firecrackers for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we were making plans, however, Beijing announced it will stop long-distance buses going into the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12361158/16x9/320/180/537f24d40ce7569dec6c0304bbf0da76/fE/workers-in-protective-suits-monitor-a-screen-showing-the-thermal-scan-to-check-temperatures-of-passengers-arriving-at-the-nanjing-railway-station--following-the-outbreak-of-a-new-coronavirus--in-nanji-5.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12361158/16x9/360/203/537f24d40ce7569dec6c0304bbf0da76/Rc/workers-in-protective-suits-monitor-a-screen-showing-the-thermal-scan-to-check-temperatures-of-passengers-arriving-at-the-nanjing-railway-station--following-the-outbreak-of-a-new-coronavirus--in-nanji-5.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12361158/16x9/450/253/537f24d40ce7569dec6c0304bbf0da76/tx/workers-in-protective-suits-monitor-a-screen-showing-the-thermal-scan-to-check-temperatures-of-passengers-arriving-at-the-nanjing-railway-station--following-the-outbreak-of-a-new-coronavirus--in-nanji-5.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12361158/16x9/550/309/537f24d40ce7569dec6c0304bbf0da76/nc/workers-in-protective-suits-monitor-a-screen-showing-the-thermal-scan-to-check-temperatures-of-passengers-arriving-at-the-nanjing-railway-station--following-the-outbreak-of-a-new-coronavirus--in-nanji-5.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12361158/16x9/670/377/537f24d40ce7569dec6c0304bbf0da76/uY/workers-in-protective-suits-monitor-a-screen-showing-the-thermal-scan-to-check-temperatures-of-passengers-arriving-at-the-nanjing-railway-station--following-the-outbreak-of-a-new-coronavirus--in-nanji-5.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12361158/16x9/768/432/537f24d40ce7569dec6c0304bbf0da76/fE/workers-in-protective-suits-monitor-a-screen-showing-the-thermal-scan-to-check-temperatures-of-passengers-arriving-at-the-nanjing-railway-station--following-the-outbreak-of-a-new-coronavirus--in-nanji-5.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12361158/16x9/991/557/537f24d40ce7569dec6c0304bbf0da76/km/workers-in-protective-suits-monitor-a-screen-showing-the-thermal-scan-to-check-temperatures-of-passengers-arriving-at-the-nanjing-railway-station--following-the-outbreak-of-a-new-coronavirus--in-nanji-5.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="Workers in protective suits monitor a screen showing the thermal scan to check temperatures of pass" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Workers in protective suits monitor a screen showing the thermal scan to check temperatures of passengers arriving at the Nanjing Railway Station, following the outbreak of a new coronavirus, during Chinese Lunar New Year holiday in Nanjing, China January 27, 2020. cnsphoto via REUTERS&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next morning, we wake to the news that our county has started asking its villages to block their road entrances, and that public bus services from the city are being suspended. Across China, other friends tell me of villages and townships embarking on self-quarantine in the national spirit of viral defence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of it may be over-zealous, as there is an ongoing debate over the effectiveness of government-imposed city-level quarantines. Borders are always leaky, and quarantines give possible viral carriers a reason to lie about their whereabouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my grandparents’ old village of some 500 people, there have been no coronavirus victims to date. There are 70 detected infections in their province of 80 million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WUHAN VIRUS ON SOCIAL MEDIA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the news landscape shifts, my relatives now discuss preventive measures with more urgency than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But news of spurious quality proliferates both online and offline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/wuhan-virus-social-media-communications-facebook-whatsapp-12364658" target=_self &gt;READ: Commentary: Wuhan virus - when social media and chat groups complicate crisis communication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my uncles recommends that we all chew garlic to stave off the virus.

An old video of a street protest is recirculated as if happening now in Wuhan (untrue), and a video of Wuhan with firecrackers going off in the background is flaunted as evidence of police shooting people trying to leave (also untrue).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much social media commentary is overlaid with disgust at Chinese people as a racial group and over their eating habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worst part of the outbreak, for many of my friends, is the terrifying headlines they feel compelled to consume about it, which leave you feeling powerless and panicked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://bit.ly/38UB0lH" target=_self &gt;LISTEN: Wuhan virus – The WHO, Singapore's infectious diseases authority and a global outbreak expert answer your burning questions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On social media, some share tips of varying helpfulness for staying safe, while others share a petition to extend the national holiday, or even lists of places in Beijing where virus victims are said to be staying. Some simply wish their friends were well, and hope we stay calm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of the dozens of articles I’ve read about the virus, I can only condense one helpful piece of advice: Wash your hands properly and dry them on clean towels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACK TO BEIJING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my second morning at my grandparents’, my uncle suggests that I go back to Beijing early, fearing more transport options would be shut down as the holiday went on. I pack my suitcase quickly, glad that the load is lightened by the presents I’ve offloaded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I have forgotten to reckon with the customary food parcels from my aunt. The next morning, as I leave for Beijing, she hands me a heavy bag packed with northern Chinese staples: steamed buns stuffed with sweet bean paste, salted duck eggs, breaded cabbage, deep-fried meatballs, and an entire cooked rooster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12372954/16x9/320/180/5505db39848d588718c01eae8cb72447/iJ/file-photo--people-wearing-masks-shop-at-a-supermarket-on-the-second-day-of-the-chinese-lunar-new-year--following-the-outbreak-of-a-new-coronavirus--in-wuhan--hubei-4.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12372954/16x9/360/203/5505db39848d588718c01eae8cb72447/Uh/file-photo--people-wearing-masks-shop-at-a-supermarket-on-the-second-day-of-the-chinese-lunar-new-year--following-the-outbreak-of-a-new-coronavirus--in-wuhan--hubei-4.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12372954/16x9/450/253/5505db39848d588718c01eae8cb72447/Ri/file-photo--people-wearing-masks-shop-at-a-supermarket-on-the-second-day-of-the-chinese-lunar-new-year--following-the-outbreak-of-a-new-coronavirus--in-wuhan--hubei-4.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12372954/16x9/550/309/5505db39848d588718c01eae8cb72447/OB/file-photo--people-wearing-masks-shop-at-a-supermarket-on-the-second-day-of-the-chinese-lunar-new-year--following-the-outbreak-of-a-new-coronavirus--in-wuhan--hubei-4.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12372954/16x9/670/377/5505db39848d588718c01eae8cb72447/kx/file-photo--people-wearing-masks-shop-at-a-supermarket-on-the-second-day-of-the-chinese-lunar-new-year--following-the-outbreak-of-a-new-coronavirus--in-wuhan--hubei-4.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12372954/16x9/768/432/5505db39848d588718c01eae8cb72447/Vd/file-photo--people-wearing-masks-shop-at-a-supermarket-on-the-second-day-of-the-chinese-lunar-new-year--following-the-outbreak-of-a-new-coronavirus--in-wuhan--hubei-4.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12372954/16x9/991/557/5505db39848d588718c01eae8cb72447/dD/file-photo--people-wearing-masks-shop-at-a-supermarket-on-the-second-day-of-the-chinese-lunar-new-year--following-the-outbreak-of-a-new-coronavirus--in-wuhan--hubei-4.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="FILE PHOTO: People wearing masks shop at a supermarket on the second day of the Chinese Lunar New Y" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; FILE PHOTO: People wearing masks shop at a supermarket on the second day of the Chinese Lunar New Year, in Wuhan, China January 26, 2020. cnsphoto via REUTERS/File Photo&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;She thrusts on me another bag filled with a dozen pink apples and a dozen oranges, saying I can eat them on the way.

Two of them invite me to their dinner parties, joking that Chinese grain liquor will help disinfect our throats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hesitate for hours before replying, wondering whether a yes or no would be overly cautious, rude or irresponsible. How are you meant to assess the risk of going to see friends, when you’re probably more likely to be killed from a traffic accident on the way there than from the coronavirus, yet people around you are panicking?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIFE IS NORMAL BUT NOT REALLY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in Beijing, the city streets are emptier than they usually are in the new year’s holiday week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are reassuring signs of normal life: I brush past green-coated guards still marching in formation around the embassy district, now with face masks on. Through a restaurant window, I see a few people eating Beijing barbeque skewers. And on the streets, the city’s migrant workers are still busy: Delivering, cleaning, hurrying everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I arrive at my apartment block, the guard at the gate to the compound hands me a pink slip of paper from the local district government. It tells us to register ourselves if we have been to coronavirus-infected areas, to wear masks outside and to keep warm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can’t cut corners on preventive measures,” the paper reads, “but we also don’t need to panic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12317152/16x9/320/180/c39854a1891096dde50f82aef525491e/FJ/passengers-are-screened-with-thermal-scanners-at-hankou-railway-station-in-wuhan-china-january-21-2020--since-china-reported-the-emergence-of-a-new-coronavirus-at-the-end-of-december-the-sars-like-vir-1579803979838-9.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12317152/16x9/360/203/c39854a1891096dde50f82aef525491e/rh/passengers-are-screened-with-thermal-scanners-at-hankou-railway-station-in-wuhan-china-january-21-2020--since-china-reported-the-emergence-of-a-new-coronavirus-at-the-end-of-december-the-sars-like-vir-1579803979838-9.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12317152/16x9/450/253/c39854a1891096dde50f82aef525491e/xe/passengers-are-screened-with-thermal-scanners-at-hankou-railway-station-in-wuhan-china-january-21-2020--since-china-reported-the-emergence-of-a-new-coronavirus-at-the-end-of-december-the-sars-like-vir-1579803979838-9.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12317152/16x9/550/309/c39854a1891096dde50f82aef525491e/UF/passengers-are-screened-with-thermal-scanners-at-hankou-railway-station-in-wuhan-china-january-21-2020--since-china-reported-the-emergence-of-a-new-coronavirus-at-the-end-of-december-the-sars-like-vir-1579803979838-9.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12317152/16x9/670/377/c39854a1891096dde50f82aef525491e/Xx/passengers-are-screened-with-thermal-scanners-at-hankou-railway-station-in-wuhan-china-january-21-2020--since-china-reported-the-emergence-of-a-new-coronavirus-at-the-end-of-december-the-sars-like-vir-1579803979838-9.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12317152/16x9/768/432/c39854a1891096dde50f82aef525491e/hp/passengers-are-screened-with-thermal-scanners-at-hankou-railway-station-in-wuhan-china-january-21-2020--since-china-reported-the-emergence-of-a-new-coronavirus-at-the-end-of-december-the-sars-like-vir-1579803979838-9.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12317152/16x9/991/557/c39854a1891096dde50f82aef525491e/Tn/passengers-are-screened-with-thermal-scanners-at-hankou-railway-station-in-wuhan-china-january-21-2020--since-china-reported-the-emergence-of-a-new-coronavirus-at-the-end-of-december-the-sars-like-vir-1579803979838-9.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="Passengers are screened with thermal scanners at Hankou railway station in Wuhan" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Passengers are screened with thermal scanners at Hankou railway station in Wuhan, China.

In the cramped convenience store on my block, I am the only customer, but there are bags filled with other people’s groceries standing on the till. As I enter, a delivery man dressed in blue electric-scooter gear is leaving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m afraid we’re mostly out of fresh vegetables,” the shopkeeper says, seeing me enter. I’ll have to walk a bit further to a larger supermarket to get mine. “We’ve had very few customers in person, but we’re getting all these delivery requests,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she explains, her smartphone’s loudspeaker blares out another order. This shop, like most small shops in big cities, has understocked for the New Year holiday, expecting a dearth of customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/wuhan-virus-animal-source-bats-snakes-wildlife-trade-market-12337906" target=_self &gt;READ: Commentary: The Wuhan virus and the problem with the wildlife trade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We plan to restock in a week, but really, I don’t think the shipments will come through for another two weeks,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where do you get your food from?” I ask, thinking of the farmland around Beijing and the villages that have sealed off their roads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where it’s produced,” she replies, flatly, as if speaking of places that do not need to be spoken of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I fish out a couple of apples from a small crate on the shop floor.

    <title>Intrigue, scandal, heartbreak: The case of South Korea’s missing ‘frog boys’</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.644519+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;DAEGU, South Korea: The phone call came on the fourth day. “I have the children. They’re all suffering. Two are very ill,” said the voice, who asked for a large sum of money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, hoped the parents, they could find their children. So they went to the designated place — with the police. But no one came. After waiting for an hour, they returned home, feeling helpless and miserable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kim Hyeon-do could talk about the case “forever”, even though it makes him cry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But words go only so far to plumb the depth of his hurt, and he hopes “no one in this world will ever go through what we went through”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody else paid much attention, however, the day he and four other sets of parents faced their worst nightmare when their children went missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Korea was preoccupied with its first local elections in 30 years. And the police regarded the boys, aged nine to 13, as runaways. It became one of the country’s most notorious missing persons cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381330/16x9/320/180/a729d14c172becf2ba0c9c96204ee278/sX/south-korea-frog-boys-3.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381330/16x9/360/203/a729d14c172becf2ba0c9c96204ee278/ev/south-korea-frog-boys-3.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381330/16x9/450/253/a729d14c172becf2ba0c9c96204ee278/Pw/south-korea-frog-boys-3.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381330/16x9/550/309/a729d14c172becf2ba0c9c96204ee278/kP/south-korea-frog-boys-3.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381330/16x9/670/377/a729d14c172becf2ba0c9c96204ee278/RD/south-korea-frog-boys-3.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381330/16x9/768/432/a729d14c172becf2ba0c9c96204ee278/av/south-korea-frog-boys-3.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381330/16x9/991/557/a729d14c172becf2ba0c9c96204ee278/Id/south-korea-frog-boys-3.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="The disappearance of the frog boys became one of South Korea's most notorious missing persons cases." class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“No one was able to solve the case of the five missing children. Isn’t that shameful?” says Woo Jong-u, one of the fathers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were reportedly over 500 leads, which all turned out to be false. There were twists and turns, police theories and conspiracy theories. “But there are no answers,” says Park Geon-seo, another of the fathers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are still searching, however, for the criminal. They recount the events as if these had happened yesterday, as if the retelling for the CNA special, In Search Of The Frog Boys, might provide clues to solve a 29-year-old mystery.

Their houses formed a circle, and the children often hung out near the paddy field in front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381334/16x9/320/180/8e1595e2cbfad1232ce0bc5d853062c7/sL/south-korea-frog-boys-4.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381334/16x9/360/203/8e1595e2cbfad1232ce0bc5d853062c7/ej/south-korea-frog-boys-4.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381334/16x9/450/253/8e1595e2cbfad1232ce0bc5d853062c7/Pk/south-korea-frog-boys-4.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381334/16x9/550/309/8e1595e2cbfad1232ce0bc5d853062c7/kD/south-korea-frog-boys-4.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381334/16x9/670/377/8e1595e2cbfad1232ce0bc5d853062c7/Qr/south-korea-frog-boys-4.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381334/16x9/768/432/8e1595e2cbfad1232ce0bc5d853062c7/aj/south-korea-frog-boys-4.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381334/16x9/991/557/8e1595e2cbfad1232ce0bc5d853062c7/Zt/south-korea-frog-boys-4.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="The five frog boys often hung out near the paddy field in front of their houses." class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The boys were closer than brothers. They were like five musketeers,” Woo says of his son Cheol-won and the rest, Chan-in, Ho-yeon, Jong-sik and Yeong-gyu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of them were the only children. Chan-in’s father, Park, said: “In some ways, we were dependent on him. He never gave us any trouble, and he was almost too sincere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim was also “very close” to his only son, Yeong-gyu. “We tried to give him all the love he deserved, and he loved us back,” said the man. “He was very bright and cheerful. He had a great personality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They went missing on March 26, 1991, which was a public holiday because of the elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My son came back to get a thicker jacket,” recalls Woo. “I asked him where he was going, but he never really answered. He just said he was going to play outside.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381258/16x9/320/180/efa27d506bd272d545d09c3e6e23fd6e/oy/south-korea-frog-boys-1.png 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381258/16x9/360/203/efa27d506bd272d545d09c3e6e23fd6e/bW/south-korea-frog-boys-1.png 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381258/16x9/450/253/efa27d506bd272d545d09c3e6e23fd6e/MX/south-korea-frog-boys-1.png 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381258/16x9/550/309/efa27d506bd272d545d09c3e6e23fd6e/gq/south-korea-frog-boys-1.png 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381258/16x9/670/377/efa27d506bd272d545d09c3e6e23fd6e/Ne/south-korea-frog-boys-1.png 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381258/16x9/768/432/efa27d506bd272d545d09c3e6e23fd6e/XW/south-korea-frog-boys-1.png 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381258/16x9/991/557/efa27d506bd272d545d09c3e6e23fd6e/FE/south-korea-frog-boys-1.png 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="South Korea frog boys 1" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was 9am. At a little past 1pm, he got a call from the taekwondo academy because his boy had not turned up. Soon afterwards, he realised his child was not the only one missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A friend told us he’d seen the five boys. He asked them where they were going. The boys replied that they were going to find lizard (salamander) eggs. That’s why we thought the boys had gone up the mountain,” he relates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up on Mount Waryong was an army base on the left, a pond on the right and a shooting range above the pond. The parents started searching the mountain but found no sign of the children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By late afternoon, reporters heard from the police that five boys had been reported missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381352/16x9/320/180/3c10c8cf0fb21ef9964c79fd53080115/RR/south-korea-frog-boys-5.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381352/16x9/360/203/3c10c8cf0fb21ef9964c79fd53080115/Dp/south-korea-frog-boys-5.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381352/16x9/450/253/3c10c8cf0fb21ef9964c79fd53080115/sq/south-korea-frog-boys-5.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381352/16x9/550/309/3c10c8cf0fb21ef9964c79fd53080115/XB/south-korea-frog-boys-5.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381352/16x9/670/377/3c10c8cf0fb21ef9964c79fd53080115/hR/south-korea-frog-boys-5.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381352/16x9/768/432/3c10c8cf0fb21ef9964c79fd53080115/Vx/south-korea-frog-boys-5.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381352/16x9/991/557/3c10c8cf0fb21ef9964c79fd53080115/Kj/south-korea-frog-boys-5.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="Mount Waryong, where South Korea's frog boys disappeared." class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Mount Waryong.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“At the beginning, it wasn’t very important news.

It’s because you didn’t look after the children!’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That night, Kim had a dream. “It was pouring. My son was right outside the door. He peeked inside, but without a word, he was gone,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I ran after him, calling his name. But he wouldn’t even turn to look back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381436/16x9/320/180/ab2a26e7faa7ad05c044007ffda24fc7/ws/south-korea-frog-boys-7.png 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381436/16x9/360/203/ab2a26e7faa7ad05c044007ffda24fc7/jQ/south-korea-frog-boys-7.png 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381436/16x9/450/253/ab2a26e7faa7ad05c044007ffda24fc7/UR/south-korea-frog-boys-7.png 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381436/16x9/550/309/ab2a26e7faa7ad05c044007ffda24fc7/ok/south-korea-frog-boys-7.png 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381436/16x9/670/377/ab2a26e7faa7ad05c044007ffda24fc7/VY/south-korea-frog-boys-7.png 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381436/16x9/768/432/ab2a26e7faa7ad05c044007ffda24fc7/fQ/south-korea-frog-boys-7.png 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381436/16x9/991/557/ab2a26e7faa7ad05c044007ffda24fc7/My/south-korea-frog-boys-7.png 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="Kim Hyeon-do, father of Yeong-gyu, one of the missing frog boys in South Korea." class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Kim Hyeon-do, father of Yeong-gyu.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A HUGE NEWS STORY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Word eventually spread of the missing children. Five or six days after their disappearance, there was the first news broadcast about five boys “still missing after trying to catch frogs”. Thus they came to be known as the frog boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Within two days, it became city-wide news. After a week, everyone was talking about whether the kids were still alive. Then the story became nationwide news,” recalls Jang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every life is important, but this case was extraordinary because it was about five kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 4, the parents participated in a news programme called The Square Of Public Opinions, in which they expressed their dissatisfaction with the investigation. They protested, for example, at police pamphlets that called the children “runaways”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This indicates that the police are trying to wrap up the case quickly,” one of the fathers said on the programme. “We want them to change this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381442/16x9/320/180/c4450617ffd20d00653511f8033e1b7a/lg/south-korea-frog-boys-8.png 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381442/16x9/360/203/c4450617ffd20d00653511f8033e1b7a/YE/south-korea-frog-boys-8.png 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381442/16x9/450/253/c4450617ffd20d00653511f8033e1b7a/JF/south-korea-frog-boys-8.png 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381442/16x9/550/309/c4450617ffd20d00653511f8033e1b7a/dY/south-korea-frog-boys-8.png 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381442/16x9/670/377/c4450617ffd20d00653511f8033e1b7a/KM/south-korea-frog-boys-8.png 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381442/16x9/768/432/c4450617ffd20d00653511f8033e1b7a/UE/south-korea-frog-boys-8.png 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381442/16x9/991/557/c4450617ffd20d00653511f8033e1b7a/Bm/south-korea-frog-boys-8.png 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="Archive footage of The Square Of Public Opinions, which was a news programme in South Korea." class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Archive footage of The Square Of Public Opinions.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The live broadcast from the boys’ Seongseo Elementary School was a “very rare” nationwide event and the “biggest opportunity to make this case known”, Jang describes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It did get a “tremendous amount” of attention — and a sudden phone call, from someone thought to have been one of the boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The call was cut off, but the telephone operator said on the programme that it was Jong-sik, sobbing and asking for his mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everyone applauded and screamed, ‘The kids are alive somewhere!’” Jang recounts. “Everyone was saying, ‘Let’s look for them now.

Thousands were mobilised to search for the boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a year, the mountain was searched, with volunteers forming lines to probe the undergrowth as they moved forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The police looked for any evidence they could find. But by then, there was no point in searching because there were no traces left. The police were just following orders … so they just pretended to do something,” says Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We, the parents, meant nothing to them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THEIR TORTUROUS TREK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five fathers were determined, however, to do everything possible for their missing children. They had quit their jobs, rented a small lorry and kept searching across the country, come rain or shine or snow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lorry had photos of the children pasted on the sides and coated to withstand rain. Written below were the words “please help find our missing children”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381476/16x9/320/180/9af7f71701312798cda2d926e9cf2a8d/VD/south-korea-frog-boys-10.png 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381476/16x9/360/203/9af7f71701312798cda2d926e9cf2a8d/Hb/south-korea-frog-boys-10.png 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381476/16x9/450/253/9af7f71701312798cda2d926e9cf2a8d/CE/south-korea-frog-boys-10.png 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381476/16x9/550/309/9af7f71701312798cda2d926e9cf2a8d/HT/south-korea-frog-boys-10.png 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381476/16x9/670/377/9af7f71701312798cda2d926e9cf2a8d/if/south-korea-frog-boys-10.png 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381476/16x9/768/432/9af7f71701312798cda2d926e9cf2a8d/sX/south-korea-frog-boys-10.png 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381476/16x9/991/557/9af7f71701312798cda2d926e9cf2a8d/vx/south-korea-frog-boys-10.png 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="The frog boys' fathers pasted photos of the children on the lorry they had rented to search for them" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We could do nothing more.

The public thought the police had done all they could.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was “heartbreaking” for the parents, recalls Kim, when the press coverage stopped. “We went to every newspaper in Seoul,” he says. “They kicked us out of their offices because of our demands.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the fathers also got into debt after their nationwide search. And they had to take care of other family members. So, three years after the boys’ disappearance, they announced that they would return to their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years later, when they finally had rebuilt their lives, there was an allegation levelled at one of them, which the police did investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Ga-won, a criminal psychologist who had studied in the United States, claimed that the children were buried in Jong-sik’s house because his father “couldn’t account for the first three hours on the day the children went missing”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381508/16x9/320/180/c0de17576e2d7c4d62984b3d011a2b55/OY/south-korea-frog-boys-13.png 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381508/16x9/360/203/c0de17576e2d7c4d62984b3d011a2b55/Aw/south-korea-frog-boys-13.png 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381508/16x9/450/253/c0de17576e2d7c4d62984b3d011a2b55/vZ/south-korea-frog-boys-13.png 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381508/16x9/550/309/c0de17576e2d7c4d62984b3d011a2b55/Ao/south-korea-frog-boys-13.png 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381508/16x9/670/377/c0de17576e2d7c4d62984b3d011a2b55/cA/south-korea-frog-boys-13.png 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381508/16x9/768/432/c0de17576e2d7c4d62984b3d011a2b55/ls/south-korea-frog-boys-13.png 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381508/16x9/991/557/c0de17576e2d7c4d62984b3d011a2b55/pS/south-korea-frog-boys-13.png 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="Kim Ga-won, a criminal psychologist, claimed that the frog boys were buried in Jong-sik’s house." class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Kim Ga-won.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the time, there were hardly any criminal psychologists in South Korea, “which made everyone trust him”, explains Na. This professor also said he had read about the investigation and had “analysed all the evidence and footage”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other parents told him that his assumptions were wrong. “Some rumours were believable, but others we couldn’t believe at all,” says Park. “It’s impossible that someone would murder his own child and bury (the child) under his own house.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the disbelief, the police searched the toilet. They found children’s shoes, “which made them think this might be a possibility”, recounts Na.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They ended up digging with an excavator,” he adds. “Jong-sik’s father was in agony. People started to think, ‘Could he really have done all of this in three hours?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The media were there, filming the event, and many people had gathered to watch.

They were tangled together, in an area a couple of kilometres from their village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the parents arrived, there was “already a group of people who’d gathered to see the bodies”, remembers Woo.

I realised that my relationship with my son was over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It “didn’t seem real” to Park, who could not recognise his child from the remains or the clothes. But the clothes were a match. The police also found the dental braces of one of the boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were filled with guilt. It was so depressing to realise what worthless parents we were,” says Kim. “We were unable to relieve the spirits of our children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was two locals, hiking up a trail and collecting acorns, who discovered the bones when they came across some old clothes among the rocks. But something was strange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One child’s remains, for example, were found with the trousers “flipped over his shoulders” and the sleeves “tied together”, describes Woo. When the knot was untied, empty cartridges and unused bullets were found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381626/16x9/320/180/d3c419475b81924288d5276a66868b03/Xy/south-korea-frog-boys-16.png 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381626/16x9/360/203/d3c419475b81924288d5276a66868b03/KW/south-korea-frog-boys-16.png 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381626/16x9/450/253/d3c419475b81924288d5276a66868b03/Ez/south-korea-frog-boys-16.png 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381626/16x9/550/309/d3c419475b81924288d5276a66868b03/KO/south-korea-frog-boys-16.png 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381626/16x9/670/377/d3c419475b81924288d5276a66868b03/la/south-korea-frog-boys-16.png 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381626/16x9/768/432/d3c419475b81924288d5276a66868b03/vS/south-korea-frog-boys-16.png 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381626/16x9/991/557/d3c419475b81924288d5276a66868b03/ys/south-korea-frog-boys-16.png 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="Archive footage of the crime scene investigation after South Korea's frog boys' remains were found." class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Archive footage of the crime scene investigation.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kim, the child’s father, had only one thought: “I was convinced that the children were shot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police called forensic scientist Chae Jong-min, a professor at Kyungbook University, to the crime scene. But he arrived to find an “absurd situation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The police weren’t specialists in excavating dead bodies. They just dug out whatever they could find. They didn’t know any better,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The police were organising the long bones and the skulls together, which was ridiculous. An expert would’ve arranged the bones together as one complete body. So for around two to three hours, the police were making many mistakes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was another heart-rending experience for Kim, who “had already cried so much by then”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How dare they treat the bones like this by arranging them in piles, then call us to look at them and ask (us) whether this is (our) child or not. We couldn’t do anything, so we became angry,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The police have the law on their side.

A day after the remains were found, the police chief said hypothermia was “the most probable cause of death”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the scene, he told journalists that the lowest temperature recorded at that time was 3°C. “But when it rains in the morning, the wind chill factor would’ve lowered the temperature, and the bodies were huddled together,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This insistence that the children died of natural causes prompted a team from the Korea Alpine Federation, who are often called in for emergencies because of their experience in mountainous areas, to check the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were certain it was not a hypothermia case. “That area isn’t high up at all. It isn’t even 100 metres from the streets. Just use some common sense,” says rescue team director Choi Won-seok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If it was cold and raining, it would’ve taken only five minutes to run home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381656/16x9/320/180/8960350261e9cd056b0127a66e1f1f98/Xo/south-korea-frog-boys-18.png 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381656/16x9/360/203/8960350261e9cd056b0127a66e1f1f98/KM/south-korea-frog-boys-18.png 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381656/16x9/450/253/8960350261e9cd056b0127a66e1f1f98/Ep/south-korea-frog-boys-18.png 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381656/16x9/550/309/8960350261e9cd056b0127a66e1f1f98/KE/south-korea-frog-boys-18.png 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381656/16x9/670/377/8960350261e9cd056b0127a66e1f1f98/lQ/south-korea-frog-boys-18.png 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381656/16x9/768/432/8960350261e9cd056b0127a66e1f1f98/vI/south-korea-frog-boys-18.png 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381656/16x9/991/557/8960350261e9cd056b0127a66e1f1f98/Uq/south-korea-frog-boys-18.png 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="Forensic unit footage from the crime scene where South Korea's frog boys' remains were found." class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Forensic unit footage.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The “strongest evidence” of foul play, according to Chae, was that “if a child died naturally, the bones would’ve been found on top of the dirt”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When a corpse is on top of the dirt, it rots or animals come and rip up the body, which means the bones would’ve been separated,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, the bones were all buried, which means that someone killed them and meticulously hid them.

But the investigation fizzled out when they could not find more evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, two years after their remains were found — and stored in the university hospital morgue — the boys had their funeral at last. “At that moment … I finally realised that it was all real,” says Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The hearse was covered with chrysanthemums. Somebody donated the flowers. I felt very grateful. At least we sent them away properly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parents took the ashes to the Nakdong River so their children could “float away into the Pacific Ocean”, Woo says, his Iips quivering at the memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park adds: “They died together, so we wanted them to play together in the afterlife.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381718/16x9/320/180/59695d6ff107e7b1f16101fdbcbb86cf/Fz/south-korea-frog-boys-22.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381718/16x9/360/203/59695d6ff107e7b1f16101fdbcbb86cf/sX/south-korea-frog-boys-22.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381718/16x9/450/253/59695d6ff107e7b1f16101fdbcbb86cf/nA/south-korea-frog-boys-22.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381718/16x9/550/309/59695d6ff107e7b1f16101fdbcbb86cf/sP/south-korea-frog-boys-22.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381718/16x9/670/377/59695d6ff107e7b1f16101fdbcbb86cf/In/south-korea-frog-boys-22.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381718/16x9/768/432/59695d6ff107e7b1f16101fdbcbb86cf/tT/south-korea-frog-boys-22.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381718/16x9/991/557/59695d6ff107e7b1f16101fdbcbb86cf/dJ/south-korea-frog-boys-22.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="A photo of the Park family, in happier times." class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; The Park family, in happier times.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The parents’ lawyer, Kang Ji-won, filed a lawsuit against the police for having “not done their jobs properly” by, for example, botching evidence at the crime scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We had three trials, and we lost them all … (The judges) didn’t arrive at any verdict that directly pinned the blame on the police.

But various people and activist groups raised objections,” says Kang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because of the frog boys’ case and others, (South) Korea’s legal system has gradually advanced. We can still hope to uncover the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381760/16x9/320/180/ca3cd6c46f54bd4471b837a0b6853d7d/pB/south-korea-frog-boys-23.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381760/16x9/360/203/ca3cd6c46f54bd4471b837a0b6853d7d/bZ/south-korea-frog-boys-23.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381760/16x9/450/253/ca3cd6c46f54bd4471b837a0b6853d7d/WC/south-korea-frog-boys-23.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381760/16x9/550/309/ca3cd6c46f54bd4471b837a0b6853d7d/bR/south-korea-frog-boys-23.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381760/16x9/670/377/ca3cd6c46f54bd4471b837a0b6853d7d/Cd/south-korea-frog-boys-23.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381760/16x9/768/432/ca3cd6c46f54bd4471b837a0b6853d7d/MV/south-korea-frog-boys-23.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12381760/16x9/991/557/ca3cd6c46f54bd4471b837a0b6853d7d/Pv/south-korea-frog-boys-23.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="The parents of South Korea's frog boys want the truth, not theories, behind their children's deaths." class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; The parents want the truth, not theories, behind their children's deaths.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Woo vows to “keep searching for the criminal until the end”. “The police have changed a great deal.

This patient came from the epicentre of this outbreak," Abeyasinghe added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-china-hubei-12379196" target=_blank &gt;READ: Wuhan coronavirus - Death toll in China rises to 304 with 45 new fatalities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 44-year-old man arrived in the Philippines with a Chinese woman who had also tested positive for the virus, health secretary Francisco Duque said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man developed severe pneumonia after being admitted to a government hospital in Manila on Jan 25, the Department of Health said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the patient who died was "stable and showed signs of improvement" during his last few days in the hospital, his condition deteriorated in the 24 hours before he died, Duque told reporters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She was the Philippines' first case of the virus and is recovering in hospital. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-embed-social--facebook  data-css=c-embed-social &gt;&lt;div class=fb-post  data-href="https://www.facebook.com/whophilippines/photos/a.514585071988103/2664930260286896/?type=3&amp;amp;theater" data-show-text=true &gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twenty-four patients previously under investigation for infection tested negative for the new coronavirus, while samples from four other patients were still being tested, the health department said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Passengers aboard the flights of the two positive cases were being traced, he said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-lockdown-hubei-cancer-blockade-coronavirus-12381982" target=_blank &gt;READ: 'Please take my daughter': Mother of woman with cancer pleads at Hubei blockade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two patients had taken Cebu Pacific flights from Hong Kong to Cebu and from Cebu to Dumaguete in central Philippines, the airline said in a statement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cabin crew and pilots on affected flights have been quarantined, and the aircraft have undergone thorough disinfection, it said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cebu Air and two other Philippine carriers, Philippine Airlines and the local unit of AirAsia Group Bhd, have cancelled flights to China this month, joining many others around the world that have done the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLOSING BORDERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO last week declared the situation a global health emergency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first foreign fatality came as an escalating number of governments around the world closed their borders to people from China in a bid to stop it spreading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Philippines announced it would immediately halt the arrivals of any foreign travellers from China. The United States, Australia and Israel have banned foreign nationals from visiting if they had been in China over the previous 14 days, and warned their own citizens from travelling there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mongolia, Russia and Nepal closed their land borders, while Papua New Guinea went as far as to ban anyone arriving from ports or airports across Asia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The death toll in China soared to 304 on Sunday, with authorities reporting 45 new deaths from the previous day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were 2,590 new confirmed cases in China, bringing the total to nearly 14,500.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>New Chinese city locked down as virus kills abroad</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.644334+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;BEIJING: China imposed a lockdown on Sunday (Feb 2) on a major city far from the epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic, as its death toll from the disease soared to 304 and the first fatality outside the country was reported in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The events added to deepening concern about the potential for the virus to spread, as governments around the world closed their borders to people from China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Struggling to contain the virus, authorities took action in the eastern city of Wenzhou on Sunday - 800km from Wuhan, the metropolis at the heart of the health emergency - closing roads and confining people to their homes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since emerging out of Wuhan late last year, the new coronavirus has infected nearly 14,500 people across China and reached 24 nations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The G7 countries - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, all of which have confirmed cases of the virus - will discuss a joint response, Germany's health minister Jens Spahn said on Sunday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-china-hubei-12379196" target=_blank &gt;READ: Death toll in China rises to 304 with 45 new fatalities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-wuhan-virus-lockdown-travel-flight-bus-quarantine-new-year-12372790" target=_blank &gt;READ: Commentary - China in a Wuhan coronavirus lockdown – life is normal but not really&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Thailand, which has 19 confirmed cases, doctors on Sunday said an elderly Chinese patient treated with a cocktail of flu and HIV drugs had shown a dramatic improvement and tested negative for the virus 48 hours later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the infections overseas have been in people who had travelled from Wuhan, an industrial hub of 11 million people, or surrounding areas of Hubei province.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-philippines-coronavirus-death-outside-china-12382000" target=_blank &gt;man who died in the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; was a 44-year-old from Wuhan, according to the World Health Organisation, which has declared the epidemic a global health emergency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;China has embarked on unprecedented efforts to contain the virus, which is believed to have jumped to humans from a Wuhan animal market, and can be transmitted among people in a similar fashion to the flu.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LOCKDOWNS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those efforts have included extraordinary quarantines in Wuhan and surrounding cities, with all transport out banned, effectively sealing-off more than 50 million people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But 10 days after locking down Wuhan, authorities imposed similar draconian measures on Wenzhou, a coastal city of nine million people in Zhejiang province, part of the eastern industrial heartland that has powered China's economic rise over recent decades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only one resident per household is allowed to go out every two days to buy necessities, and 46 highway toll stations have been closed, authorities announced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city had previously closed public places such as cinemas and museums, and suspended public transport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zhejiang has 661 confirmed infections, with 265 of those in Wenzhou, according to the government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the highest tally for any province in China after ground-zero Hubei.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLOSING BORDERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Internationally, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Israel have banned foreign nationals from visiting if they have been in China recently, and they have also warned their own citizens against travelling there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mongolia, Russia and Nepal have closed their land borders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number of countries reporting infections rose to 24 after Britain, Russia and Sweden confirmed their first cases this weekend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The death toll in China climbed to 304 on Sunday after authorities reported 45 new deaths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were 2,590 new confirmed cases in China, bringing the total to nearly 14,500.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number of confirmed infections in China is far higher than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002-03.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SARS, caused by a pathogen similar to the new coronavirus and also originated in China, killed 774 people worldwide - most of them in mainland China and Hong Kong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With hospitals in Wuhan overwhelmed, China will on Monday open a military-led field hospital that was built in just 10 days to treat people stricken by the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/chinese-army-oversee-wuhan-coronavirus-hospital-12382676" target=_blank &gt;READ: Wuhan coronavirus: Chinese army to oversee virus hospital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with the Chinese economy suffering, the &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/people-bank-china-pump-billion-economy-virus-fight-boost-12382398" target=_blank &gt;central bank announced it would release 1.2 trillion yuan (US$173 billion)&lt;/a&gt; on Monday to maintain liquidity in the banking system -- the day markets re-open after the long holiday break.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOLIDAY ENDING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The emergence of the virus coincided with the Chinese New Year, when hundreds of millions travel across the country in planes, trains and buses for family reunions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The holiday, which was scheduled to end on Friday, was extended by three days to give authorities more time to try to deal with the crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With many due back at work on Monday, people were starting to return on planes and trains over the weekend, with almost everyone wearing face masks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Custom authorities had ordered temperature checks at all exit-entry points in Beijing, according to state media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Returning travellers were being checked and registered at residential compounds, while fever checks were in place in subway stations, offices and cafes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One 22-year-old arriving at a Beijing train station from northeastern China said her family had urged her to delay her return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"But I was worried it would affect my job," she said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Security guard Du Guiliang, 47, said he would be starting back at work in Beijing on Sunday, after returning from northeast Liaoning province.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Many colleagues (from Hubei) couldn't come back. Now, those who work the day shift at our company have to do the night shift as well," he said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many businesses were to remain closed for at least another week, however, while some major cities - including Shanghai - had also extended the holiday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many foreigners, meanwhile, have started to leave China to wait things out abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"(My family) said I need to go home," said 22-year-old South African student Jamie Bosch as she waited for a flight out of Beijing on Sunday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Philippines detects first African swine fever outbreak in southern province</title>

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;MANILA: Blood samples taken from pigs in a southern province in the Philippines, the world's 10th-largest pork consumer, tested positive for the African swine fever virus, the Department of Agriculture said on Sunday (Feb 2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the first reported case of African swine fever infections in Davao Occidental province and elsewhere in Mindanao, the southern island of the Southeast Asian nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Agriculture Secretary William Dar has ordered regional department officials to restrict animal movement in that part of the archipelago, the department said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Philippines, also the world's seventh-biggest pork importer, reported its first &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/philippines-reports-more-african-swine-fever-outbreaks-11934560" target=_blank &gt;African swine fever outbreak in September 2019&lt;/a&gt;, in some backyard farms near the country's capital, Manila.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease quickly spread to other parts of the main island of Luzon, including Manila, prompting some central and southern provinces to ban pork and pork-based products from disease-hit areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dar has said pork smuggled from China, where millions of pigs were culled because of the disease, could be behind the outbreak in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although the blood samples from pigs in Davao Occidental had already tested positive for African swine fever, further tests were to be undertaken by the department's Bureau of Animal Industry for confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department said the initial tests covered blood samples from more than a dozen villages in the province.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The provincial government has already imposed a "complete, but temporary, lock down", prohibiting the transport of pigs and pork products from and into Davao Occidental, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Backyard pig farmers in the area practice group rearing of hogs, from different owners, most (of them without) proper housing provisions nor biosecurity practices," the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also no regular vaccination, vitamin supplementation and deworming of pigs in the province, and household butchering is common, especially with animals exhibiting weakness or disease, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around a thousand pigs in Davao Occidental have been culled amid the outbreak, according to local media reports, citing information from the provincial government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philippine agricultural output grew at an annual pace of 0.4 per cent in the last quarter of 2019, slower than the 2.9 per cent gain in the September quarter, as hogs production contracted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though not harmful to humans, the disease is deadly to pigs, with no vaccine available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;BEIJING: A claim by Chinese scientists that a liquid made with honeysuckle and flowering plants could help fight the deadly coronavirus has sparked frenzied buying of the traditional medicine, but doubts quickly emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the death toll from the SARS-like pathogen sweeping the country continues to rise, shoppers have swamped pharmacies in search of "Shuanghuanglian".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rush came after influential state media outlet Xinhua reported Friday (Jan 31) that the esteemed Chinese Academy of Sciences had found the concoction "can inhibit" the virus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/faq-wuhan-coronavirus-and-its-outbreak-12373466" target=_blank &gt;READ: FAQ: Wuhan coronavirus and its outbreak &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videos shared online showed long lines of people in surgical masks lining up at night outside drug stores, purportedly in hope of snapping up the product, despite official advice that people avoid public gatherings to prevent infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It quickly sold out both online and at brick-and-mortar stores, but responses to the remedy's supposed efficacy have ranged from enthusiasm to scepticism on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;And state media sounded a more cautionary note on Saturday, with broadcaster CCTV publishing an interview with Zhang Boli, one of the researchers leading outbreak containment efforts, who warned of potential side effects from the medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-lockdown-hubei-cancer-blockade-coronavirus-12381982" target=_blank &gt;READ: 'Please take my daughter': Mother of woman with cancer pleads at Hubei blockade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12382324/16x9/320/180/c4e00e3515ffc980df0b538c2f014660/Ol/surgical-masks-are-being-worn-across-china-as-a-preventative-measure-against-the-coronavirus-1580627703832-5.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12382324/16x9/360/203/c4e00e3515ffc980df0b538c2f014660/BJ/surgical-masks-are-being-worn-across-china-as-a-preventative-measure-against-the-coronavirus-1580627703832-5.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12382324/16x9/450/253/c4e00e3515ffc980df0b538c2f014660/Qy/surgical-masks-are-being-worn-across-china-as-a-preventative-measure-against-the-coronavirus-1580627703832-5.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12382324/16x9/550/309/c4e00e3515ffc980df0b538c2f014660/Dp/surgical-masks-are-being-worn-across-china-as-a-preventative-measure-against-the-coronavirus-1580627703832-5.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12382324/16x9/670/377/c4e00e3515ffc980df0b538c2f014660/hp/surgical-masks-are-being-worn-across-china-as-a-preventative-measure-against-the-coronavirus-1580627703832-5.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12382324/16x9/768/432/c4e00e3515ffc980df0b538c2f014660/rh/surgical-masks-are-being-worn-across-china-as-a-preventative-measure-against-the-coronavirus-1580627703832-5.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12382324/16x9/991/557/c4e00e3515ffc980df0b538c2f014660/KL/surgical-masks-are-being-worn-across-china-as-a-preventative-measure-against-the-coronavirus-1580627703832-5.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="Surgical masks are being worn across China as a preventative measure against the coronavirus" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Surgical masks are being worn across China as a preventative measure against the coronavirus.

On Sunday &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-philippines-coronavirus-death-outside-china-12382000" target=_blank &gt;the Philippines reported the first death outside of China&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the state-run academy, a top government think tank, are also studying the potential use of a plant commonly known as Japanese knotweed to alleviate symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Health Commission on Tuesday said TCM practitioners were among nearly 6,000 reinforcement medical personnel being sent to Wuhan in Hubei province, ground zero of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'NO DIFFERENCE'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategy has reignited fierce and long-running debate about the efficacy of TCM, which has a history going back 2,400 years and remains popular in modern-day China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marc Freard, a member of the Chinese Medicine Academic Council of France, told AFP he believed traditional formulations could be used to treat people with symptoms ranging from fever to thick phlegm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he warned that many remedies on the market were of questionable quality and admitted that TCM "lacks scientific standards of efficacy" because it relied on "individualised treatment".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-city-wenzhou-outside-coronavirus-epicentre-wuhan-12382090" target=_blank &gt;READ: Chinese city outside coronavirus epicentre in Wuhan shuts down&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional medicines were widely used in China in conjunction with Western methods during the 2003 epidemic of SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which killed 774 people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a 2012 study in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews found combining Chinese and Western medicines "made no difference" in battling the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12382328/16x9/320/180/c7958ea5bb2a7d9dc1eca1969f38c9d8/TM/several-countries-have-barred-chinese-travellers-due-to-fears-about-the-coronavirus-1580627703832-3.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12382328/16x9/360/203/c7958ea5bb2a7d9dc1eca1969f38c9d8/Fk/several-countries-have-barred-chinese-travellers-due-to-fears-about-the-coronavirus-1580627703832-3.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12382328/16x9/450/253/c7958ea5bb2a7d9dc1eca1969f38c9d8/nh/several-countries-have-barred-chinese-travellers-due-to-fears-about-the-coronavirus-1580627703832-3.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12382328/16x9/550/309/c7958ea5bb2a7d9dc1eca1969f38c9d8/GI/several-countries-have-barred-chinese-travellers-due-to-fears-about-the-coronavirus-1580627703832-3.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12382328/16x9/670/377/c7958ea5bb2a7d9dc1eca1969f38c9d8/iA/several-countries-have-barred-chinese-travellers-due-to-fears-about-the-coronavirus-1580627703832-3.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12382328/16x9/768/432/c7958ea5bb2a7d9dc1eca1969f38c9d8/rs/several-countries-have-barred-chinese-travellers-due-to-fears-about-the-coronavirus-1580627703832-3.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12382328/16x9/991/557/c7958ea5bb2a7d9dc1eca1969f38c9d8/Vq/several-countries-have-barred-chinese-travellers-due-to-fears-about-the-coronavirus-1580627703832-3.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="Several countries have barred Chinese travellers due to fears about the coronavirus" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Several countries have barred Chinese travellers due to fears about the coronavirus.

    <title>Chinese central bank to pump US$173 billion to economy in fight against virus</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.644153+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;BEIJING: China's central bank said Sunday (Feb 2) it would pump 1.2 trillion yuan (US$173 billion) into the economy as it ramps up support for a nationwide fight against a deadly virus that is expected to hit growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement it would launch a 1.2 trillion yuan reverse repurchase operation on Monday to maintain "reasonable and abundant liquidity" in the banking system, as well as a stable currency market, during the epidemic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It added that the overall liquidity of the banking system would be 900 billion yuan (US$129 billion) more than in the same period last year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The move will kick in the day that China's financial markets reopen, following an extended Spring Festival break.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The virus has now infected &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/wuhan-virus-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-china-hubei-12379196" target=_blank &gt;over 14,000 people in China&lt;/a&gt; and claimed over 300 lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/wuhan-virus-philippines-coronavirus-death-outside-china-12382000" target=_blank &gt;READ: Philippines reports first Wuhan coronavirus death outside China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/wuhan-virus-lockdown-hubei-cancer-blockade-coronavirus-12381982" target=_blank &gt;READ: 'Please take my daughter': Mother of woman with cancer pleads at Hubei blockade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, the PBOC also announced a range of measures to step up monetary and credit support to enterprises which are helping in its fight against the virus epidemic, such as medical companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's central bank urged financial institutions to provide "sufficient credit resources" to hospitals and other medical organisations, among other measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move to inject liquidity into its financial system comes as the virus threatens to take a toll on an already slowing economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;China saw economic growth of 6.1 per cent last year, the slowest in around three decades. Analysts are warning this could weaken further if the spread of the SARS-like virus goes on for an extended period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Tokyo to 'strengthen testing' for coronavirus before Olympics</title>

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;TOKYO: Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike promised Sunday (Feb 2) to implement "thorough measures" to protect people from the deadly coronavirus in the run-up to this summer's Olympic Games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the opening of the US$330 million Ariake Arena, venue for Olympic volleyball and Paralympic wheelchair basketball, Koike said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I will implement even more stringent measures to tackle infectious diseases. I am having discussions this weekend with senior officials to assure the safety and security of people in Tokyo - specifically focusing on ways to prevent the spread of the virus and strengthen testing systems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koike also urged people to wash their hands and wear surgical masks to help protect them from disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan has warned citizens against non-essential travel to China, where the outbreak began, and fast-tracked new rules including limits on entering the country as it tries to contain the spread of the virulent new coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/wuhan-virus-japan-three-cases-coronavirus-12382078" target=_blank &gt;READ: Japan confirms three new cases of Wuhan coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12374754/16x9/320/180/9281d98d5b9031061fe01086a1573a1e/CT/tourists-wearing-protective-masks-walk-past-the-kaminarimon-gate-as-they-visit-sensoji-temple-in-tokyo-3.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12374754/16x9/360/203/9281d98d5b9031061fe01086a1573a1e/or/tourists-wearing-protective-masks-walk-past-the-kaminarimon-gate-as-they-visit-sensoji-temple-in-tokyo-3.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12374754/16x9/450/253/9281d98d5b9031061fe01086a1573a1e/SY/tourists-wearing-protective-masks-walk-past-the-kaminarimon-gate-as-they-visit-sensoji-temple-in-tokyo-3.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12374754/16x9/550/309/9281d98d5b9031061fe01086a1573a1e/Nf/tourists-wearing-protective-masks-walk-past-the-kaminarimon-gate-as-they-visit-sensoji-temple-in-tokyo-3.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12374754/16x9/670/377/9281d98d5b9031061fe01086a1573a1e/Nn/tourists-wearing-protective-masks-walk-past-the-kaminarimon-gate-as-they-visit-sensoji-temple-in-tokyo-3.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12374754/16x9/768/432/9281d98d5b9031061fe01086a1573a1e/Xf/tourists-wearing-protective-masks-walk-past-the-kaminarimon-gate-as-they-visit-sensoji-temple-in-tokyo-3.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12374754/16x9/991/557/9281d98d5b9031061fe01086a1573a1e/HV/tourists-wearing-protective-masks-walk-past-the-kaminarimon-gate-as-they-visit-sensoji-temple-in-tokyo-3.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="Tourists wearing protective masks walk past the Kaminarimon Gate as they visit Sensoji Temple in To" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Tourists wearing protective masks walk past the Kaminarimon Gate as they visit Sensoji Temple in Tokyo, Japan, Jan 31, 2020.

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;SEOUL: Kim Min-jun's elation at news that South Korea would evacuate its citizens from the epicentre of a virus epidemic in China quickly faded when he learned his Chinese wife would be unable to accompany him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Korea arranged this week to airlift hundreds of its citizens from Wuhan, which has been the centre of an outbreak that has claimed more than 300 lives in China and on Sunday the first victim overseas, in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Chinese regulations meant Chinese nationals like Kim's wife of three years could not leave, forcing the family to make a heartbreaking decision to stay together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-china-hubei-12379196" target=_blank &gt;READ: Wuhan coronavirus - Death toll in China rises to 304 with 45 new fatalities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fears over his seven-month-old son's safety led Kim, 31, and his family to fly to South Korea briefly last month to get a flu vaccination in the hopes it would lessen the chances of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They returned to Wuhan just in time for the Chinese government to impose a lockdown on January 23, restricting travel out of the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;"While in Korea, we had indeed thought about staying longer because of the virus but we had no idea it would become so serious, and we also have our business," Kim, who has run a Korean restaurant in Wuhan since 2015, told Reuters from the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-lockdown-hubei-cancer-blockade-coronavirus-12381982" target=_blank &gt;READ: 'Please take my daughter': Mother of woman with cancer pleads at Hubei blockade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When South Korea announced the evacuation plans, joy gave way to disappointment when he realised they could not leave as a family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 700 South Koreans flew out of Wuhan on two flights last week, and will spend at least the next two weeks in precautionary isolation at government-run facilities in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for at least 120 other South Korean residents of Wuhan, family and other ties meant leaving was out of the question, according to Jeong Tae-il, head of the South Korean community in Hubei Province, where Wuhan is located.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-wuhan-virus-lockdown-travel-flight-bus-quarantine-new-year-12372790" target=_blank &gt;READ: Commentary: China in a Wuhan coronavirus lockdown – life is normal but not really&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-flies-citizens-home-to-virus-hit-wuhan-12378978" target=_blank &gt;READ: China flies citizens home to virus-hit Wuhan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim tried to be philosophical about not being evacuated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, we were disappointed but it can't stay like this forever," Kim said. "For my son, perhaps it's better we're here because he's too young to go through the isolation plans and sudden schedule change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family has spent the last week holed up at home, surviving off stockpiled food and avoiding the outside world out of fear that their son could be infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Kim says he is well supplied, he fears they might run out of powdered milk for the baby if the lockdown is extended beyond February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm afraid to go out, not for myself but for him, because all of the hospitals are full and there's no way to get him treated if he gets sick from me," Kim said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Cricket: Bumrah bowls India to T20 series sweep against New Zealand</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.643892+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;MOUT MAUNGANUI: A dramatic New Zealand collapse in which six wickets fell for 25 runs gave India a seven-run win in the fifth and final Twenty20 at Mount Maunganui on Sunday (Feb 2) to sweep the series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jasprit Bumrah led the rout to finish with the impressive figures of three for 12 off his four overs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;New Zealand had looked on track to get a consolation win with senior batsman Ross Taylor, celebrating his 100th Twenty20 international, leading the chase to reel in India's 163 for three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor made 53 and Tim Seifert an even 50 as they put on 99 for the fourth wicket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 45 balls remaining, New Zealand were three for 116 and needed 48 to win, but when Seifert went for 50 India reasserted their dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the start of the last over New Zealand had been reduced to nine for 143 and although Ish Sodhi belted two sixes India retained control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tourists' celebrations however were mixed with concern for Rohit Sharma who was unbeaten on 60 when he was forced to retire hurt with a calf injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Zealand made a disastrous start to their run chase losing three for 17 off the first 20 deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin Guptill was given out lbw to Bumrah in the second over and walked without seeking a review while replays showed the ball would have gone over the stumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colin Munro was bowled by Washington Sundar in the next over and six balls later Tom Bruce was run out without scoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor and Seifert set about restoring the innings and when they smacked 34 off Shivam Dube in the 10th over -- with two sixes and a four each, plus a single for Seifert and an extra run from a no ball -- the momentum was firmly in New Zealand's favour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Seifert's dismissal triggered a collapse that New Zealand could not recover from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharma was India's stand-in captain with Virat Kohli rested after leading his side to victory in the first four matches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After winning the toss and electing to bat, India lost Sanju Samson for two in the second over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharma put on 88 with KL Rahul (45) for the second wicket and had added 42 with Shreyas Iyer before he was injured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iyer was unbeaten on 33 at the close with Manish Pandey on 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teams start the first of a three-match one-day international series in Hamilton on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Cocktail of flu, HIV drugs appears to help fight coronavirus: Thai doctors</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.643823+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;BANGKOK: Thai doctors have seen success in treating severe cases of the new coronavirus with combination of medications for flu and HIV, with initial results showing vast improvement 48 hours after applying the treatment, they said on Sunday (Feb 2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctors from Rajavithi Hospital in Bangkok said a new approach in coronavirus treatment had improved the condition of several patients under their care, including one 70-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan who tested positive for the coronavirus for 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The drug treatment includes a mixture of anti-HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, in combination with flu drug oseltamivir in large doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-china-hubei-12379196" target=_blank &gt;READ: Wuhan coronavirus: Death toll in China rises to 304 with 45 new fatalities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is not the cure, but the patient's condition has vastly improved. From testing positive for 10 days under our care, after applying this combination of medicine the test result became negative within 48 hours," Dr Kriangska Atipornwanich, a lung specialist at Rajavithi, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The outlook is good but we still have to do more study to determine that this can be a standard treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chinese health officials have already been administering the HIV and flu drugs to fight the coronavirus. The use of the three together in a cocktail seemed to improve the treatment, the Thai doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/chinese-tourists-desert-thai-resort-as-wuhan-coronavirus-spreads-12378028" target=_blank &gt;READ: Chinese tourists desert Thai resort as Wuhan coronavirus spreads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-thailand-first-human-coronavirus-transmission-12374356" target=_blank &gt;READ: Thailand confirms first human-to-human coronavirus transmission, total cases rise to 19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another doctor said that a similar approach in two other patients resulted in one displaying some allergic reaction but the other showed improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have been following international practices, but the doctor increased the dosage of one of the drugs," said Somsak Akkslim, director-general of the Medical Services Department, referring to the flu medicine Oseltamivir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thailand has recorded 19 cases of coronavirus. Of the Thai patients, eight have recovered and gone home while 11 are still under treatment in hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somsak said the health ministry will meet on Monday to discuss the successful treatment in the case of the 70-year-old but said it is still too soon to say that this approach can be applied to all cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Initially we will apply this approach only to severe cases," he said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

There's nothing to do, so I just decided to go home."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bosch, who is from South Africa, said she was worried if she did contract the virus, she would be isolated, with no family support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(My family) said I need to go home," she said, adding that she would return when school re-opens in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHINESE TRAVELLERS AFFECTED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icaro Medeiros, 22, a student at Beijing's Central University of Finance and Economics, said his family cancelled their planned February visit to China after Beijing closed off tourist attractions such as the Great Wall and Forbidden City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I decided to leave Beijing because we are not sure when the semester will start again," he said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All of my friends have returned home, so there wasn't any reason for me to stay in Beijing alone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12382848/16x9/320/180/b06b15eebeb111e5c6fcb8f858d540e7/OF/a-young-girl-greets-a-foreign-resident-at-jingshan-park-after-snowfall-in-beijing-1580644051859-3.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12382848/16x9/360/203/b06b15eebeb111e5c6fcb8f858d540e7/Ad/a-young-girl-greets-a-foreign-resident-at-jingshan-park-after-snowfall-in-beijing-1580644051859-3.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12382848/16x9/450/253/b06b15eebeb111e5c6fcb8f858d540e7/PW/a-young-girl-greets-a-foreign-resident-at-jingshan-park-after-snowfall-in-beijing-1580644051859-3.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12382848/16x9/550/309/b06b15eebeb111e5c6fcb8f858d540e7/MF/a-young-girl-greets-a-foreign-resident-at-jingshan-park-after-snowfall-in-beijing-1580644051859-3.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12382848/16x9/670/377/b06b15eebeb111e5c6fcb8f858d540e7/zB/a-young-girl-greets-a-foreign-resident-at-jingshan-park-after-snowfall-in-beijing-1580644051859-3.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12382848/16x9/768/432/b06b15eebeb111e5c6fcb8f858d540e7/It/a-young-girl-greets-a-foreign-resident-at-jingshan-park-after-snowfall-in-beijing-1580644051859-3.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12382848/16x9/991/557/b06b15eebeb111e5c6fcb8f858d540e7/vH/a-young-girl-greets-a-foreign-resident-at-jingshan-park-after-snowfall-in-beijing-1580644051859-3.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="A young girl greets a foreign resident at Jingshan park after snowfall in Beijing" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; A young girl greets a foreign resident at Jingshan park after snowfall in Beijing (Photo: AFP/NICOLAS ASFOURI)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese citizens too have seen their plans derailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wang Yulu, 46, was on her way to the airport with her daughter on Saturday when they learned that Australia had barred non-citizens arriving from China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her daughter was due to begin a university semester in Australia, but the pair were forced to turn back to Changchun city in northeast China even before they arrived at the airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It can't be helped, we won't be going," said Wang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They don't want us Chinese citizens there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Afghanistan seeks to quarantine any coronavirus cases</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.643702+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;KABUL: Afghan health authorities are establishing isolation wards across the country ahead of a potential influx of coronavirus cases, an official said Sunday (Feb 2), as governments worldwide monitor the disease's spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No cases have been recorded in Afghanistan so far, and the war-torn country's health services have set up screening units at airports and borders, public health minister Ferozuddin Feroz said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"We have put serious measures in place," Feroz told reporters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He said that in Kabul, authorities have created a 100-bed isolation ward, and another 200 or so beds will be made available across the country in Afghanistan's creaking hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/faq-wuhan-coronavirus-and-its-outbreak-12373466" target=_blank &gt;READ: FAQ: Wuhan coronavirus and its outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feroz said 262 people - including 233 Afghans - who flew into Kabul's airport from China during the past week had all been screened, and health officials have remained in contact with them to check on their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shanghai University student Nezamuddin Nekzad, who spoke to reporters at the airport after arriving home from China, said he had decided to return to Afghanistan because life had become fairly restrictive in Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We couldn't go outside and stayed at home," Nekzad said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was "a little bit difficult to find food, so we (came back) to our country."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 40 Afghan students are currently in Wuhan - the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak in China. Feroz said the Afghan government had a chartered plane at the ready to bring them home if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus is similar to the SARS pathogen and has killed more than 300 people in China and spread around the world since emerging in Wuhan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, China's National Health Commission said &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-china-hubei-12379196" target=_blank &gt;more than 14,000 people&lt;/a&gt; have been infected by the novel coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside mainland China, there have been more than 100 infections reported in more than 20 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization has &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-who-international-emergency-declare-12372372" target=_blank &gt;declared an international emergency&lt;/a&gt; over the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>US universities set up front-line defences to keep coronavirus at bay</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.643650+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;ILLINOIS: On its sprawling campus in America's heartland, thousands of miles from China, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has taken aggressive steps to keep the fast-spreading coronavirus away from its classrooms and students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The school, with one of the highest percentages of Chinese students among US universities, has suspended academic programmes in China for the spring semester and banned students from travelling to the country for academic-related matters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;It has advised faculty and staff to follow federal travel advisories that, as of Friday, warned against going to China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to take all of the precautions we can so, in the worst-case scenario, we keep our community healthy," said Robin Kaler, associate chancellor for public affairs at the University of Illinois, 217 kilometres south of Chicago, where the &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/wuhan-virus-us-first-person-human-coronavirus-transmission-12372262" target=_blank &gt;first human-to-human transmission of the disease in the United States&lt;/a&gt; was confirmed last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 350,000 Chinese students are pursuing higher education in the United States and 10,000 American students are enrolled in academic programmes in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sheer number of the students, many of whom have travelled to their home country in recent weeks, makes schools a potential incubator for a widespread outbreak in the United States, given the close proximity of dormitory life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Colleges and universities are very much on the front line of those because of our role as global institutions," Sarah Van Orman, chief health officer at the University of Southern California (USC) said. "The challenge is making sure that we are being prudent without overstating the risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In dealing with the new outbreak, officials at US colleges and universities can draw from their experiences with previous public health scares, including the 2003 outbreak of the SARS coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A 'DELICATE BALANCE'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At University of Illinois, with some 5,800 Chinese students, Kaler sees a challenge in keeping the campus free of the new coronavirus without infringing on rights or fanning xenophobia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a need to strike a "delicate balance" between public safety and personal freedom when dealing with a growing public health issue, Kaler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, officials would prefer to err on the side of caution. "If they want to come and fuss at us later, we would rather have them be alive to be able to come fuss at us than not," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USC, where 6,600 students from China attend college, has taken similar steps in banning students from travelling to China and strongly advising against faculty making the trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at the school have encouraged concerned students from Wuhan, the outbreak's epicentre in central China, to talk with school counsellors about their concerns for loved ones back home, while trying not to stigmatize Chinese students on campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the new coronavirus has spread to more than 20 countries, all of the nearly 260 deaths as of Saturday have occurred in China, with the vast majority of the thousands of cases recorded in and around Wuhan, capital of Hubei province.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's an unfortunate history about many communicable diseases that have started in one population," said Van Orman, whose school has a total student population of 48,800. "It leads to harm for those individuals and does nothing to stop the spread of the illness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York University (NYU), where more than 7,000 Chinese students go to college, has pushed back the start of its spring semester at NYU Shanghai by two weeks to Feb 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 60,000-student school has also made available online course work and alternative programmes abroad to students affected by the postponement and travel restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university's health centre staff "are being particularly vigilant about getting travel and contact histories as they evaluate students who present with respiratory ailments and complaints," said NYU spokesman John Beckman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of Illinois officials contacted each of its 150 students from Wuhan and asked them to take the necessary precautions and, if they were feeling ill, to immediately seek medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many students who went home to Wuhan recently responded to the school and said they were self-quarantining. The dean of students is helping those students work with their professors in order for them to continue their studies while at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The students obviously are very concerned themselves," Kaler said. "We have found our students very responsible and receptive when we have asked them to take precautions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sight of many Asian students wearing masks as a preventative measure when they are on campus may lead to stereotyping and discrimination, according to Kaler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We try to be sensitive to that sort of thing because we don't ever want any of our students to feel singled out or unwelcome simply because of where they come from," she said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;HONG KONG: The novel coronavirus outbreak has killed hundreds and infected more than 14,000 in China within the last two months. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 15 cities in China are locked down, accounting for a population of over 50 million people. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given the virus continues to spread worldwide, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/faq-wuhan-coronavirus-and-its-outbreak-12373466" target=_blank &gt;public health emergency&lt;/a&gt; of international concern on Friday (Jan 31).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More countries, including the US, UK, and Canada, have warned against nonessential travel to China as well as established travel restrictions to tourists &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among many, Singapore has also blocked the entry of tourists who had visited Hubei province in the past 14 days, or who hold passports issued in the province, and just these past few days, &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/wuhan-virus-travel-restrictions-all-visitors-china-12374324" target=_blank &gt;widened these restrictions&lt;/a&gt; to all visitors with recent travel history to China. Malaysia has also stopped issuing visas to Chinese travellers from Hubei.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KEY TOURISM MARKETS AFFECTED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tourism industry – which include hotels, airlines, casinos and restaurants - is expected to suffer massively during the outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, officials in Thailand estimate potential lost revenue at 50 billion baht (US$1.6 billion) around Lunar New Year this year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/wuhan-virus-johor-tourism-sector-malaysia--12369062" target=_blank &gt;READ: Wuhan virus: Johor steps up precautions as tourism sector braces for impact &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/wuhan-virus-how-prepared-your-company-work-flexible-continuity-12369936" target=_blank &gt;READ: Commentary: Wuhan virus – how prepared is your company?

(Photo: AFP/Paul LAKATOS)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The timing could not be worse. The coronavirus outbreak occurring during the Chinese Lunar New Year, one of the biggest travel seasons in Asia, when hundreds of millions of Chinese return to homes or take holidays, both domestically and internationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tourism industries in China and key countries that rely on Chinese tourists will suffer the most immediate repercussions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute, 6.3 million Chinese tourists travel abroad during the 2019 Lunar New Year holiday, generating travel revenue of around 513.9 billion yuan (US$73 billion).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the outbreak, the Institute predicted 7 million Chinese tourists would travel abroad during the Lunar New Year this year. Hong Kong, Thailand and Japan are top favourite travel destinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese visitors make up the largest source market of Hong Kong, accounting for around 78 per cent (around 44 million) of the total number of visitor arrivals in Hong Kong for the entire 2019 (of 56 million).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, Hong Kong’s appeal to Chinese tourists has already been weakened by months of political protests, with inbound tourism already down 56 per cent from a year earlier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with the coronavirus outbreak, Hong Kong has now suspended flights and train services to Wuhan and cancelled all Lunar New Year celebrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong Marathon, originally scheduled for early February, had also &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/hong-kong-declares-wuhan-virus-outbreak-emergency-12335866" target=_blank &gt;been called off&lt;/a&gt;. Hong Kong airlines are cutting the number of their flights to the mainland by about half through the end of March in response to government virus-control efforts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these additional virus-control policies will hit the Hong Kong tourism industry harder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/coronavirus-koreans-evacuated-from-wuhan-12374476" target=_blank &gt;READ: Commentary: Coronavirus – Where should Koreans evacuated from Wuhan stay?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/wuhan-virus-social-media-communications-facebook-whatsapp-12364658" target=_blank &gt;READ: Commentary: Wuhan virus - when social media and chat groups complicate crisis communication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of Chinese visitors to Japan has also exploded from around 450,000 in 2003 to 8.4 million in 2018, accounting for 27 per cent of all inbound tourists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese tourists are also big spenders in many other cities, like London, Paris and New York. For example, China remains the fifth-largest source of foreign tourism to the US, behind Canada, Mexico, the UK and Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 3 million Chinese tourists also travelled to the US in 2018, spending more than US$36 billion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12371944/16x9/320/180/f5143f362c0f76dfdb6321456e2e244d/Zg/chinese-tourists-pose-on-a-beach-at-an-island-in-phang-nga-province-7.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12371944/16x9/360/203/f5143f362c0f76dfdb6321456e2e244d/ME/chinese-tourists-pose-on-a-beach-at-an-island-in-phang-nga-province-7.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12371944/16x9/450/253/f5143f362c0f76dfdb6321456e2e244d/Tt/chinese-tourists-pose-on-a-beach-at-an-island-in-phang-nga-province-7.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12371944/16x9/550/309/f5143f362c0f76dfdb6321456e2e244d/Wk/chinese-tourists-pose-on-a-beach-at-an-island-in-phang-nga-province-7.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12371944/16x9/670/377/f5143f362c0f76dfdb6321456e2e244d/Ik/chinese-tourists-pose-on-a-beach-at-an-island-in-phang-nga-province-7.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12371944/16x9/768/432/f5143f362c0f76dfdb6321456e2e244d/Sc/chinese-tourists-pose-on-a-beach-at-an-island-in-phang-nga-province-7.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12371944/16x9/991/557/f5143f362c0f76dfdb6321456e2e244d/RG/chinese-tourists-pose-on-a-beach-at-an-island-in-phang-nga-province-7.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="Chinese tourists pose on a beach at an island in Phang-Nga province" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Chinese tourists pose on a beach at an island in Phang-Nga province, Thailand January 30, 2020.

The number of confirmed cases has jumped to more than 14,000, surpassing the 5,329 in China from SARS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the International Monetary Fund, China accounted for 4.3 per cent of world economic output in 2003, and this number jumped to 16.3 per cent last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the novel coronavirus will affect the world economy more significantly when compared to the SARS outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRUDENT STRATEGY TO SCREEN ALL TRAVELLERS MORE THOROUGHLY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That the novel coronavirus happened during the midst of the Chinese Lunar New Year period shows why tourism is one way in which the virus spread rather quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the imposition of travel restrictions on travellers from Hubei or China more largely, countries must screen all travellers from other countries just as thoroughly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/wuhan-virus-coronavirus-evacuated-flight-quarantine-experience-12377328" target=_blank &gt;READ: Commentary: Lucky to have flown out of Wuhan, but many feel mixture of concern and uncertainty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://bit.ly/2S6PKqF" target=_blank &gt;LISTEN: Wuhan virus – The WHO, Singapore's infectious diseases authority and a global outbreak expert answer your burning questions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new coronavirus is able to transfer from one person to another, so crowded tourist attractions and closed spaces in planes definitely will speed up its spread.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All but one reported death from the outbreak have so far occurred in China, but travellers have spread the virus to numerous other places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases have been confirmed in numerous countries including Australia, Cambodia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, the UK, the US and Vietnam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/wuhan-virus-singapore-cases-response-sars-2003-quarantine-12360244" target=_blank &gt;READ: Commentary: SARS was scary, but the experience was invaluable in shaping our Wuhan virus response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt;

    <title>Commentary: Weaker growth prospects herald bad news for businesses and financial markets</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.643370+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;NEW HAVEN, Connecticut: Only now are we becoming aware of the danger the global economy narrowly avoided in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the International Monetary Fund’s preliminary, world GDP grew by just 2.9 per cent last year – the weakest performance since the outright contraction in the depths of the global financial crisis in 2009 and far short of the 3.8 per cent pace of post-crisis recovery over the 2010 to 2018 period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the surface, 2.9 per cent global growth doesn’t appear too shabby. But 40 years of perspective says otherwise. Since 1980, trend world GDP growth has averaged 3.5 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For any economy, including the world as a whole, the key to assessing growth implications can be found in deviations from the trend – a proxy for the so-called output gap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year’s shortfall from trend (0.6 percentage points) brought growth uncomfortably close to the widely accepted global recession threshold of approximately 2.5 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AN ANOMALY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unlike individual economies, which normally contract in an outright recession, that is rarely the case for the world as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know from the IMF’s extensive coverage of the world economy, which consists of a broad cross-section of some 194 countries, that in a global recession about half of the world’s economies are typically contracting, while the other half are still expanding – albeit at a subdued pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global recession of a decade ago was a notable exception: By early 2009, fully three-quarters of the world’s economies were actually shrinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That tipped the scales to a rare outright contraction in world GDP, the first such downturn in the overall global economy since the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/8088170/16x9/320/180/e2addd32f442418e896010840ca4c8b4/QX/china-economy---2588246.png 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/8088170/16x9/360/203/e2addd32f442418e896010840ca4c8b4/Cv/china-economy---2588246.png 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/8088170/16x9/450/253/e2addd32f442418e896010840ca4c8b4/MM/china-economy---2588246.png 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/8088170/16x9/550/309/e2addd32f442418e896010840ca4c8b4/Pz/china-economy---2588246.png 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/8088170/16x9/670/377/e2addd32f442418e896010840ca4c8b4/EX/china-economy---2588246.png 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/8088170/16x9/768/432/e2addd32f442418e896010840ca4c8b4/OP/china-economy---2588246.png 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/8088170/16x9/991/557/e2addd32f442418e896010840ca4c8b4/HB/china-economy---2588246.png 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="China economy" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Many countries fell short of their growth potential in the 2010s. &lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE DANGER ZONE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For global business-cycle analysts, this 2.5 to 3.5 per cent growth band is considered the danger zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When world output growth slips to the lower half of that range – as it did in 2019 – the risks of global recession need to be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is typically the case for official, or institutional, forecasts, the IMF is projecting a modest acceleration of annual world GDP growth in 2020 and 2021, to 3.3 per cent and 3.4 per cent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/singapore-economy-outlook-2020-labour-market-sectors-12222200" target=_blank &gt;READ: Commentary: The Singapore economy in 2020 - stabilisation or more uncertainties on the horizon?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/singapore-economy-2019-shocks-surprises-jobs-us-china-trade-war-12136678" target=_blank &gt;READ: Commentary: Shocks lined a rather demanding year for Singapore and the global economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as the physicist Niels Bohr once said, “Prediction is very difficult, especially if it is about the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just ask the IMF, which has revised down six consecutive iterations of its global forecast.

And before that, there was the increasingly contentious US-China trade war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point is that below-trend global growth, especially when it moves into the lower half of the 2.5 to 3.5 per cent range, is nearing its stall speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That leaves the world much more susceptible to recession than it would otherwise be in a more vigorous environment of above-trend global growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GLOBAL TRADE HAS ALSO WEAKENED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same message comes through loud and clear in gauging the risks to the global trade cycle – long the major engine of global growth in an increasingly integrated, supply-chain-linked world economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IMF’s latest assessment put global trade growth at just 1 per cent in 2019 – its seventh consecutive downward revision. Indeed, last year was the weakest trade performance since the historic 10.4 per cent plunge in 2009, which was the worst contraction since the early 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to the 5 per cent average over the 2010 to 2018 period, the slowdown of world trade growth to just 1 per cent in 2019 is all the more alarming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, it was the fourth-weakest year since 1980, and the three worse years – 1982, 2001, and 2009 – were all associated with global recessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/2020-economic-outlook-singapore-trade-growth-implications-12206242" target=_blank &gt;READ: Commentary: The brewing discontent with trade and one step to restoring faith in globalisation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/end-of-the-decade-global-economy-2010s-12214836" target=_blank &gt;READ: Commentary: The end of the decade – the world is in more debt and it isn’t going away&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global trade growth has never recovered to its pre-crisis pace, a shortfall that has been the subject of intense debate in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially thought to be a consequence of unusual weakness in business capital spending, there can be no ignoring the impact of protectionism following the start of the US-China trade conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WISHFUL THINKING ABOUT THE US-CHINA TRADE DISPUTE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the two sides have agreed to a truce in the form of a “phase one” trade deal, there is hope that the trade prognosis will improve. Reflecting that hope, the IMF’s January update calls for a modest rebound to 3.3 per cent average growth in world trade over the 2020 to 2021 period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with the average US tariff rate on Chinese imports likely to remain at about 19 per cent after the accord is signed – more than six times the pre-trade-war rate of 3 per cent – and with worrisome signs of escalating US-Europe trade tensions, this forecast, like those of the past several years, may turn out be wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12205684/16x9/320/180/f5ac5d38fa56e1f2c03baa9f1aff7451/ln/employees-work-at-the-production-line-of-aluminium-rolls-at-a-factory-in-zouping-1.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12205684/16x9/360/203/f5ac5d38fa56e1f2c03baa9f1aff7451/YL/employees-work-at-the-production-line-of-aluminium-rolls-at-a-factory-in-zouping-1.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12205684/16x9/450/253/f5ac5d38fa56e1f2c03baa9f1aff7451/A0/employees-work-at-the-production-line-of-aluminium-rolls-at-a-factory-in-zouping-1.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12205684/16x9/550/309/f5ac5d38fa56e1f2c03baa9f1aff7451/Or/employees-work-at-the-production-line-of-aluminium-rolls-at-a-factory-in-zouping-1.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12205684/16x9/670/377/f5ac5d38fa56e1f2c03baa9f1aff7451/gr/employees-work-at-the-production-line-of-aluminium-rolls-at-a-factory-in-zouping-1.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12205684/16x9/768/432/f5ac5d38fa56e1f2c03baa9f1aff7451/qj/employees-work-at-the-production-line-of-aluminium-rolls-at-a-factory-in-zouping-1.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12205684/16x9/991/557/f5ac5d38fa56e1f2c03baa9f1aff7451/NN/employees-work-at-the-production-line-of-aluminium-rolls-at-a-factory-in-zouping-1.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="Employees work at the production line of aluminium rolls at a factory in Zouping" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Employees work at the production line of aluminium rolls at a factory in Zouping, Shandong province, China, China has seen a gradual shift of production capacity to ASEAN, caused by structural factors and accelerated by its trade war with the US.

Historically, the rapid expansion of cross-border trade has been an important part of the global growth cushion that shields the world economy from all-too-frequent shocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1990 to 2008, annual growth in world trade was fully 82 per cent faster than world GDP growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, however, reflecting the unusually sharp post-crisis slowdown in global trade growth, this cushion has shrunk dramatically, to just 13 per cent over the 2010 to 2019 period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the world economy operating dangerously close to stall speed, the confluence of ever-present shocks and a sharply diminished trade cushion raises serious questions about financial markets’ increasingly optimistic view of global economic prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stephen S Roach, a faculty member at Yale University and former Chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, is the author of Unbalanced: The Codependency of America and China.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;BEIJING: The number of total infections in China's coronavirus outbreak has passed 17,200 nationwide with 2,829 new cases confirmed, the National Health Commission said on Monday (Feb 3). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its daily update, the commission said there had been 57 new deaths from the virus - all in hardest-hit Hubei province except one in the southwestern megalopolis of Chongqing, bringing the national toll to 361.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-china-citizens-overseas-coronavirus-hubei-tourists-12372960" target=_blank &gt;READ: China to fly overseas citizens back to virus-hit Hubei province&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fresh toll came a day after China imposed a lockdown on a major city far from the epicentre and the first fatality outside the country was reported in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-embed-social--youtube  data-css=c-embed-social &gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder=0  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jJUaq6XhdLs" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities in Hubei, the province at the epicentre of the outbreak, reported 56 new fatalities. That took the toll in China to 360, exceeding the 349 mainland fatalities from the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Struggling to contain the virus, authorities &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-city-wenzhou-outside-coronavirus-epicentre-wuhan-12382090" target=_blank &gt;took action in the eastern city of Wenzhou&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, closing roads and confining people to their homes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wenzhou is around 800km from Wuhan, the metropolis at the heart of the health emergency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The G7 countries - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States - have all confirmed cases of the virus. They will discuss a joint response, Germany's health minister Jens Spahn said on Sunday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Thailand, which has 19 confirmed cases, doctors said on Sunday that an elderly Chinese patient &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-coronavirus-hiv-flu-drugs-remedy-thailand-12383016" target=_blank &gt;treated with a cocktail of flu and HIV drugs&lt;/a&gt; had shown dramatic improvement and tested negative for the virus 48 hours later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the infections overseas have been detected in people who travelled from Wuhan, an industrial hub of 11 million people, or surrounding areas of Hubei province.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-philippines-coronavirus-death-outside-china-12382000" target=_blank &gt;man who died in the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; was a 44-year-old from Wuhan, according to the World Health Organization, which has declared the epidemic a global health emergency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;China has embarked on unprecedented efforts to contain the virus, which is believed to have jumped to humans from a Wuhan animal market, and can be transmitted among people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI: China's central bank unexpectedly lowered the interest rates on reverse repurchase agreements by 10 basis points on Monday (Feb 3), as authorities stepped up measures to relieve pressure on the economy from a rapidly spreading virus outbreak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said on its website that it was lowering the 7-day reverse repo rate to 2.4 per cent from 2.5 per cent, and cutting the 14-day tenor to 2.55 per cent from 2.65 per cent previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/wuhan-virus-china-new-cases-death-toll-12384204" target=_blank &gt;READ: China coronavirus cases exceed 17,000 nationwide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cut came as Chinese financial markets reopened after an extended Chinese New Year holiday, when the death toll from the virus and number of infections had climbed sharply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Monday, the PBOC also injected a total of 1.2 trillion yuan (US$173.81 billion) into money markets through reverse bond repurchase agreements. Markets had widely expected the liquidity move but most analysts thought rate cuts might follow later once the economic impact was more clear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

(Photo: Reuters/Thomas Peter)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors were bracing for volatility when onshore trade in Chinese stocks, bonds, yuan and commodities resumed, following a steep global selldown on fears about the impact of the virus on the world's second-biggest economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will last for some time," said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's uncertain whether factory workers, or how many of them, will return to their factories," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We haven't yet seen corporate earnings since the (spread of the) coronavirus. Restaurants and retailers may have very little sales."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 2,500 stocks fell by the daily limit of 10 per cent. The Shanghai Composite last sat at 2,734.7 and the onshore yuan at 7.0165 per dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copper sank to its lowest in more than three years, falling by its daily limit of 7 per cent, while aluminium, zinc and lead shed more than 4 per cent and soybeans dropped 2 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bond prices, meanwhile, surged, with March futures contracts for 10-year bonds jumping 1.5 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLEAR MESSAGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid the selldown, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) injected 1.2 trillion yuan (US$173.81 billion) into money markets through reverse bond repurchase agreements. It also unexpectedly &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/wuhan-virus-china-central-bank-cuts-reverse-repo-rates-economy-12384558" target=_blank &gt;cut the interest rate&lt;/a&gt; on those short-term funding facilities by 10 basis points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's securities regulator moved to limit short selling and urged mutual fund managers not to sell shares unless they face investor redemptions, sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a clear message that they want to take growth-supportive measures and keep the market reassured," said Mayank Mishra, macro strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore of the PBOC move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are managing the situation well. The timing of the repo rate cut came a little quicker than some people were expecting, but they wanted to send a clear message."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beijing has also said it would help firms that produce vital goods resume work as soon as possible, state broadcaster CCTV reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cities like Wuhan, where the virus originated, remain in virtual lockdown and China is facing mounting international isolation. Analysts are beginning to suspect the impact will be deeper than the hit delivered by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although most analysts agree it is too early to estimate the impact of (the virus) on the global economy, one thing I am increasingly more certain of is that the near-term shock to Chinese economy will be much higher than that in SARS period," said Tommy Xie, head of Greater China research at OCBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The shock to Chinese manufacturing and industry sectors is likely to be unprecedented."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/people-bank-china-pump-billion-economy-virus-fight-boost-12382398" target=_blank &gt;READ: Chinese central bank to pump US$173 billion to economy in fight against virus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12384710/16x9/320/180/26ac12389d370629c98c8a0979190e2e/Lc/woman-wears-a-face-mask-in-a-market-alley-in-jiujiang-15.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12384710/16x9/360/203/26ac12389d370629c98c8a0979190e2e/lU/woman-wears-a-face-mask-in-a-market-alley-in-jiujiang-15.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12384710/16x9/450/253/26ac12389d370629c98c8a0979190e2e/ZJ/woman-wears-a-face-mask-in-a-market-alley-in-jiujiang-15.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12384710/16x9/550/309/26ac12389d370629c98c8a0979190e2e/xs/woman-wears-a-face-mask-in-a-market-alley-in-jiujiang-15.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12384710/16x9/670/377/26ac12389d370629c98c8a0979190e2e/eg/woman-wears-a-face-mask-in-a-market-alley-in-jiujiang-15.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12384710/16x9/768/432/26ac12389d370629c98c8a0979190e2e/oY/woman-wears-a-face-mask-in-a-market-alley-in-jiujiang-15.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12384710/16x9/991/557/26ac12389d370629c98c8a0979190e2e/WG/woman-wears-a-face-mask-in-a-market-alley-in-jiujiang-15.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="Woman wears a face mask in a market alley in Jiujiang" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; A woman wears a face mask in a market alley in Jiujiang, Jiangxi province, China, as the country is hit by an outbreak of a new coronavirus, Feb 1, 2020.

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;WUHAN: Scientists at China's top research body in natural sciences have found another possible mode of transmission of the novel coronavirus which originated in Wuhan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus, which has claimed the lives of &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-china-new-cases-death-toll-12384204" target=_blank &gt;more than 360 people in China&lt;/a&gt;, could be transmitted through the digestive system and into human faeces, according to scientists cited in a report by China's Xinhua news agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-china-citizens-overseas-coronavirus-hubei-tourists-12372960" target=_blank &gt;READ: China to fly overseas citizens back to virus-hit Hubei province&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-coronavirus-hiv-flu-drugs-remedy-thailand-12383016" target=_blank &gt;READ: Cocktail of flu, HIV drugs appears to help fight coronavirus: Thai doctors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that the virus could be ingested through the faecal-oral route, where pathogens can pass through faeces and into the mouth of another person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may occur due to poor hygiene practices, lack of sanitation, pollution of soil and water bodies with faecal matter or contamination of food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and the Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences noticed that the initial symptom of some patients infected with the coronavirus was diarrhoea instead of fever, a more common symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team found viral nucleic acids in patients' stool and rectal swabs, and believes that the novel coronavirus has certain faecal-oral transmission possibilities, in addition to droplet and contact transmissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/wuhan-coronavirus-singapore-new-cases-feb-2-12381694" target=_blank &gt;READ: No new cases of Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore, total remains at 18: MOH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/wuhan-virus-singapore-what-we-know-confirmed-cases-12324270" target=_blank &gt;READ: Wuhan virus in Singapore: What we know about the confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;China confirmed on Monday more than 17,000 cases of the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first coronavirus death outside China was &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-philippines-coronavirus-death-outside-china-12382000" target=_blank &gt;reported on Sunday in the Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, a day after China imposed a &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-city-wenzhou-outside-coronavirus-epicentre-wuhan-12382090" target=_blank &gt;lockdown on a major city&lt;/a&gt; far from the epicentre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the infections overseas have been detected in people who travelled from Wuhan, an industrial hub of 11 million people, or surrounding areas of Hubei province.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has embarked on unprecedented efforts to contain the virus, which is believed to have come from a Wuhan animal market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from China, human-to-human transmission has also been reported in &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-south-korea-local-transmission-human-12371292" target=_blank &gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/japan-wuhan-virus-first-patient-travel-china-12361596" target=_blank &gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, Germany and &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-thailand-first-human-coronavirus-transmission-12374356" target=_blank &gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>China's death toll from coronavirus surpasses SARS</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.643149+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;BEIJING: China's death toll from a new coronavirus jumped above 360 on Monday (Feb 3) to surpass the number of fatalities of its SARS crisis two decades ago, with dozens of people dying in the epicentre's quarantined ground-zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 57 confirmed new deaths was the single-biggest increase since the virus was detected late last year in the central city of Wuhan, where it is believed to have jumped from animals at a market into humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The virus has since spread to more than 24 countries, despite many governments imposing unprecedented travel bans on people coming from China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World Health Organisation has declared the crisis a global health emergency, and the first foreign death from the virus was reported in the Philippines on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-china-new-cases-death-toll-12384204" target=_blank &gt;READ: China coronavirus cases exceed 17,000 nationwide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About 1,400 military medics will treat patients at the hospital, dubbed "Fire God Mountain", according to state media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However with the death toll surging in Wuhan and elsewhere in Hubei province, it was not immediately clear what overall impact the hospitals would have on the virus spreading elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a worrying signal about it already spreading in significant numbers to other parts of China, the eastern industrial city of Wenzhou was on Sunday placed under a similar lockdown to Wuhan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roads in Wenzhou, 800 kilometres to the east, were closed and its nine million people were ordered to stay indoors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only one resident per household in Wenzhou is allowed to go out every two days to buy necessities, authorities announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt;

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;HONG KONG: Panic-stricken residents have emptied shelves in major supermarkets in Hong Kong, stockpiling meat, rice, cleaning products and soap as fears escalate over a &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-china-new-cases-death-toll-12384204" target=_blank &gt;coronavirus epidemic&lt;/a&gt; on the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rush to procure food in the city of 7.4 million people is unprecedented, residents say, describing it as far worse than the panic during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that killed nearly 800 people around the world, including nearly 300 in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new coronavirus originated in central China's Hubei province and has so far killed 361 people in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend in Hong Kong, hundreds of people queued for hours to buy masks and immune-boosting products such as vitamin C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-coronavirus-wuhan-death-toll-spikes-more-than-sars-12385274" target=_blank &gt;READ: China's death toll from coronavirus surpasses SARS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-picture--article is-original" data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;img alt="A vegetable stall owner wears a face mask in a wet market in Mei Foo district" class="picture__image lazyload" data-src="/image/12385306/0x0/1024/681/c19825b76457dae8e9efcdf95f5d613d/NF/a-vegetable-stall-owner-wears-a-face-mask-in-a-wet-market-in-mei-foo-district.jpg"/&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; A vegetable stall owner wears a face mask in a wet market in the Mei Foo district of Hong Kong.

I think everyone is afraid of what is going to happen in the next few days. Prices are also going to rise," said Cindy, a retail executive who was buying dry food and soap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of mask-wearing shoppers pushed trolleys down empty aisles showing sold-out signs for hand wash and antiseptic liquids. Others tried to stock up on remaining bags of rice and packaged noodles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rush to buy food and cleaning products comes as some shoppers said they were concerned that a potential shutdown of the border would impact the supply of products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-coronavirus-hiv-flu-drugs-remedy-thailand-12383016" target=_blank &gt;READ: Cocktail of flu, HIV drugs appears to help fight coronavirus: Thai doctors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12385210/16x9/320/180/56a07eb11bee4ed58aeb309741adb72a/KA/hong-kong-residents-stocking-up-on-food.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12385210/16x9/360/203/56a07eb11bee4ed58aeb309741adb72a/wY/hong-kong-residents-stocking-up-on-food.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12385210/16x9/450/253/56a07eb11bee4ed58aeb309741adb72a/eF/hong-kong-residents-stocking-up-on-food.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12385210/16x9/550/309/56a07eb11bee4ed58aeb309741adb72a/RM/hong-kong-residents-stocking-up-on-food.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12385210/16x9/670/377/56a07eb11bee4ed58aeb309741adb72a/fs/hong-kong-residents-stocking-up-on-food.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12385210/16x9/768/432/56a07eb11bee4ed58aeb309741adb72a/QY/hong-kong-residents-stocking-up-on-food.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12385210/16x9/991/557/56a07eb11bee4ed58aeb309741adb72a/Py/hong-kong-residents-stocking-up-on-food.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="Hong Kong residents stocking up on food" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Customers wear masks as they buy items at a food market, in Hong Kong, China, Feb 2, 2020.

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;TAIPEI: Shut out of the World Health Organization, Taiwan is facing a dual problem in tackling the &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-china-new-cases-death-toll-12384204" target=_blank &gt;threat of a new coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;: It is being included as a high-risk area as part of China but is unable to get epidemic information firsthand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwan is denied membership of most international organisations including the WHO, a UN agency, due to the objections of China, which considers it a Chinese province with no right to participate unless it accepts it is part of China, something Taiwan's government will not do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taiwan has long complained about China's belittling of it on the international stage and its forcing of foreign governments and companies to refer to it as part of China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with the virus biting, Taiwan says this policy means it has become collateral damage, as despite having only 10 cases compared with more than 17,000 in China, where the virus emerged in December, the WHO is lumping Taiwan's cases together with China's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-coronavirus-wuhan-death-toll-spikes-more-than-sars-12385274" target=_blank &gt;READ: China's death toll from coronavirus surpasses SARS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12385626/16x9/320/180/228d2101420a9e477c7c0a6b30b89711/zr/people-wear-face-masks-at-a-shopping-mall-in-taipei.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12385626/16x9/360/203/228d2101420a9e477c7c0a6b30b89711/Zj/people-wear-face-masks-at-a-shopping-mall-in-taipei.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12385626/16x9/450/253/228d2101420a9e477c7c0a6b30b89711/JY/people-wear-face-masks-at-a-shopping-mall-in-taipei.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12385626/16x9/550/309/228d2101420a9e477c7c0a6b30b89711/BL/people-wear-face-masks-at-a-shopping-mall-in-taipei.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12385626/16x9/670/377/228d2101420a9e477c7c0a6b30b89711/Jj/people-wear-face-masks-at-a-shopping-mall-in-taipei.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12385626/16x9/768/432/228d2101420a9e477c7c0a6b30b89711/Tb/people-wear-face-masks-at-a-shopping-mall-in-taipei.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12385626/16x9/991/557/228d2101420a9e477c7c0a6b30b89711/vx/people-wear-face-masks-at-a-shopping-mall-in-taipei.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="People wear face masks at a shopping mall in Taipei" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; People wear face masks at a shopping mall in Taipei, Jan 31, 2020.

It's very obvious that under China's pressure they can't show flexibility," he said on Sunday (Feb 2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the WHO, while still listing Taiwan as part of China, is now referring to it as "Taipei", rather than "Taiwan, China" as it did in its initial situation reports, Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a small change, but from our perspective it's still far from enough. The biggest problem is they are still putting us under China."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a rare diplomatic success for Taiwan, it managed on Saturday to get Vietnam to lift its ban on flights to the island, which it had also initially listed under China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-chinese-markets-plunge-global-fears-death-toll-12384714" target=_blank &gt;READ: Chinese markets plunge US$420 billion as novel coronavirus death toll rises&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12324562/16x9/320/180/dcb85b4b6f6635c44015f4f0ec818129/Mq/foxconn-employees-wearing-masks-attend-the-company-s-year-end-gala-in-taipei-3.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12324562/16x9/360/203/dcb85b4b6f6635c44015f4f0ec818129/zO/foxconn-employees-wearing-masks-attend-the-company-s-year-end-gala-in-taipei-3.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12324562/16x9/450/253/dcb85b4b6f6635c44015f4f0ec818129/ov/foxconn-employees-wearing-masks-attend-the-company-s-year-end-gala-in-taipei-3.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12324562/16x9/550/309/dcb85b4b6f6635c44015f4f0ec818129/MC/foxconn-employees-wearing-masks-attend-the-company-s-year-end-gala-in-taipei-3.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12324562/16x9/670/377/dcb85b4b6f6635c44015f4f0ec818129/AK/foxconn-employees-wearing-masks-attend-the-company-s-year-end-gala-in-taipei-3.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12324562/16x9/768/432/dcb85b4b6f6635c44015f4f0ec818129/KC/foxconn-employees-wearing-masks-attend-the-company-s-year-end-gala-in-taipei-3.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12324562/16x9/991/557/dcb85b4b6f6635c44015f4f0ec818129/xM/foxconn-employees-wearing-masks-attend-the-company-s-year-end-gala-in-taipei-3.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="Foxconn employees wearing masks attend the company&amp;amp;apos;s year-end gala in Taipei" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Foxconn employees wearing masks attend the company's year-end gala in Taipei, Taiwan, Jan 22, 2020.

    <title>China says it 'urgently needs' medical masks to tackle virus</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.642928+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;BEIJING: China said Monday (Feb 3) it urgently needed medical equipment and surgical masks as the &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-china-new-cases-death-toll-12384204" target=_blank &gt;death toll from a new coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; jumped above 360, making it more deadly than the SARS crisis nearly two decades ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 57 new deaths confirmed Monday was the single-biggest daily increase since the virus was detected late last year in the central city of Wuhan, where it is believed to have jumped from animals at a market into humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The virus has since spread to more than 24 countries despite many governments imposing unprecedented travel bans on arrivals coming from China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The World Health Organization has declared the crisis a global health emergency, and the first foreign death from the virus was confirmed in the Philippines on Sunday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"What China urgently needs at present are medical masks, protective suits, and safety goggles," foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a press briefing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-china-hong-kong-residents-stock-up-food-essentials-12385150" target=_blank &gt;READ: Fearing novel coronavirus, Hong Kong residents stock up on food, essentials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Authorities in provinces that are home to more than 300 million people - including Guangdong, the country's most populous - have ordered everyone to wear masks in public in an effort to contain the virus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But factories capable of producing around 20 million masks a day are only operating at between 60 and 70 per cent of capacity, industry department spokesman Tian Yulong said, adding that supply and demand remained in "tight equilibrium" as a result of the Lunar New Year break.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tian said authorities were taking steps to bring in masks from Europe, Japan and the US, while the foreign ministry said countries including South Korea, Japan, Kazakhstan and Hungary had donated medical supplies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All but one of the 57 new deaths reported Monday were in Wuhan and the rest of Hubei province, most of which has been under lockdown for almost two weeks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The national death toll &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-coronavirus-wuhan-death-toll-spikes-more-than-sars-12385274" target=_blank &gt;reached 361&lt;/a&gt;- exceeding the 349 mainland fatalities from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002-03.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number of infections also jumped significantly, passing 17,200.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SARS, caused by a pathogen similar to the new coronavirus and also originated in China, killed 774 people - with most other deaths in Hong Kong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ECONOMIC WOES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The virus is taking an increasing economic toll, shutting down businesses across China, curbing international travel and impacting production lines of major global brands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shanghai stock market plunged almost eight per cent Monday on the first day of trading since the holiday as investors played catch-up with last week's global retreat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Wuhan, which has been transformed from a bustling industrial hub into a near-ghost town, residents have been living in deep fear of catching the virus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The city's medical facilities have been overwhelmed, with state news agency Xinhua reporting Monday that 68 medical teams of 8,300 staff had been sent to Hubei.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And amid mounting pressure, the government has been racing to build two new hospitals to treat the infected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first of those, a 1,000-bed facility, was due to open on Monday, just 10 days after construction began.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, with the death toll surging in Wuhan and other areas of Hubei, it was not immediately clear what overall impact the hospitals would have on containing the epidemic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The industrial city of Wenzhou, 800 kilometres (500 miles) to the east, was placed under a similar lockdown to Wuhan on Sunday and its nine million people ordered to stay indoors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRAVEL CURBS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The emergence of the virus coincided with the Chinese New Year, when hundreds of millions travel across the country for family reunions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally scheduled to end last Friday, the holiday was extended by three days to give authorities more time to deal with the crisis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But some major cities - including Shanghai - extended it again, and many schools and universities have delayed the start of new terms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Road traffic on Sunday, when hundreds of millions of people would have been expected to return to their cities of work, was down 80 per cent, the transport ministry said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Train journeys were down 74 per cent on last year, according to Xinhua, and plane trips a fifth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many companies offered staff the option to work from home or defer travel, or simply remained closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STOPPING THE SPREAD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The G7 countries - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the United States - have all confirmed cases of the virus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US, Australia, New Zealand and Israel have banned foreign nationals from visiting if they have been in China recently, and they have also warned their own citizens against travelling there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many nations have evacuated hundreds of their citizens from China - with some forcing them into quarantine on their return - and more airlines are cancelling services to the mainland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The foreign ministry Monday criticised the US for being the first to evacuate nationals without providing "substantial assistance" to China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US actions had caused "panic", said spokeswoman Hua Chunying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mongolia, Russia and Nepal have closed their land borders, while semi-autonomous Hong Kong announced Monday it was closing all but two land crossings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also on Monday the Cruise Lines International Association, that represents some of the world's largest operators, said vessels will deny boarding to passengers and crew who have recently travelled to China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last week over 6,000 passengers spent around 12 hours in lockdown on the Costa Smeralda cruise ship in an Italian port until two Chinese tourists feared to have the virus tested negative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>China says US creating, spreading fear after virus outbreak</title>

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;BEIJING: The United States has taken actions that create and spread fear following a &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-china-new-cases-death-toll-12384204" target=_blank &gt;coronavirus outbreak in China&lt;/a&gt;, instead of offering significant aid, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Monday (Feb 3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States was the first nation to suggest partial withdrawal of its embassy staff, and the first to &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/wuhan-coronavirus-us-declares-public-health-emergency-12376630" target=_blank &gt;impose a ban on Chinese travellers&lt;/a&gt;, said ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Washington has "unceasingly manufactured and spread panic", Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters, noting that the World Health Organization (WHO) had advised against trade and travel curbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is precisely developed countries like the United States with strong epidemic prevention capabilities and facilities that have taken the lead in imposing excessive restrictions contrary to WHO recommendations," she added, saying countries should make reasonable, calm and science-based judgements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In China, 361 people have died with more than 17,000 infected from the virus, which originated in the central city of Wuhan. At least another 171 cases have been reported in more than two dozen other countries and regions, from the United States to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-coronavirus-wuhan-death-toll-spikes-more-than-sars-12385274" target=_blank &gt;READ: China's death toll from coronavirus surpasses SARS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-slams-us-for-travel-warning-over-virus-12376254" target=_blank &gt;READ: China slams US for travel warning over virus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducting her daily news briefing via the WeChat app rather than in person, Hua also chided the United States for lack of help. "So far, the US government has yet to provide any substantial assistance to China," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That contrasted with President Donald Trump's weekend comments that US officials had offered "tremendous help." However, his national security adviser Robert O'Brien told an interviewer China had not yet accepted US offers of aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tensions over the coronavirus come after the two world's largest economies have only just started to patch up relations from an 18-month trade war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump said over the weekend the United States had "shut down" the coronavirus threat. "We can't have thousands of people coming in who may have this problem," he told broadcaster Fox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Vietnam have also announced restrictions on travel from China, while numerous nations have been evacuating citizens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States on Jan 28 began evacuating US citizens from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have first emerged late last year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) on Jan 30 declared the accelerating outbreak a global emergency. On the same day, the US State Department raised its travel advisory for China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Hong Kong economy shrinks for first time in a decade</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.642854+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;HONG KONG: The Hong Kong economy's first recession in a decade deepened in the fourth quarter of last year, weighed down by often violent anti-government protests and the US-China trade war, advanced estimates showed on Monday (Feb 3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data was released as Hong Kong began the Chinese New Year facing another economic crisis - the outbreak of a deadly new coronavirus strain which began on mainland China and is compounding Hong Kong's economic woes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year was the worst for Hong Kong's growth since 2009, when the financial hub was hit hard by the global financial crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crisis was initially sparked by the trade war between Beijing and Washington, hitting the export-heavy economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the hard times were made worse by months of seething and often violent protests seeking greater democracy and police accountability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Official figures released on Monday showed Hong Kong's gross domestic product shrank 1.2 per cent on-year for 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fourth quarter - which witnessed the worst violence between police and protesters - clocked a 2.9 per cent contraction, the third straight quarter of declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The local social incidents with violence during the quarter took a further heavy toll on economic sentiment as well as consumption and tourism related activities," the government said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Total exports of goods continued to decline amid the difficult external environment, though at a somewhat narrower rate," it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/wuhan-virus-chinese-markets-plunge-global-fears-death-toll-12384714" target=_blank &gt;READ: Chinese markets plunge US$420 billion as novel coronavirus death toll rises&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/people-bank-china-pump-billion-economy-virus-fight-boost-12382398" target=_blank &gt;READ: Chinese central bank to pump US$173 billion to economy in fight against virus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analysts predict an even worse first quarter in 2020, as measures to restrict cross-border mobility to fight the spread of a new coronavirus, which originated in mainland China deal a further blow to tourism, retail and other business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong, which has so far seen 15 confirmed cases of the virus, has taken measures to reduce the flow of visitors from China where the death toll has risen to 361. The city's retail and tourism sectors rely heavily on spenders from the Chinese mainland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The coronavirus is grabbing the headlines, but the protests haven't gone away," said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING, who expects the economy to contract by 4.5 per cent this year and return to mild growth in 2021 "if the virus is contained".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Retail, catering, tourism, mass transportation are all suffering."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANZ analysts predicted a 1.4 percentage point negative impact on Hong Kong's first quarter gross domestic product from the effects of the virus, making it the worst hit region in Asia outside mainland China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital Economics expects the virus to shave off 2 percentage points off Hong Kong's first quarter growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong - one of the world's most important financial hubs with total banking, fund and wealth management assets worth more than US$6 trillion - has pledged HK$35 billion (US$4.5 billion) in stimulus to prop up the economy. Further measures are expected in a budget announcement later in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Novel coronavirus: Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announces suspension of 10 border crossings with mainland China</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.642813+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;HONG KONG: Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced on Monday (Feb 3) the suspension of 10 border crossings out of 13 with mainland China in a bid to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, stopping short of calls for the entire border to be closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city's airport - one of the world's busiest - would remain open to mainlanders, although there are already restrictions on people from central Hubei province where the epidemic began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lam, chief executive of Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, was speaking hours after more than 2,500 workers from the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance (HAEA) &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/hong-kong-medical-workers-strike-china-border-close-coronavirus-12385604" target=_blank &gt;went on strike&lt;/a&gt; to call for the border to be shut and better protection for hospital staff, among other demands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We should be united if we have the same goal. At this critical moment, (some people are) taking extreme means and it is inevitable it will affect the rights of patients," Lam said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those using extreme means to try to force the government's hand will not succeed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-china-new-cases-death-toll-12384204" target=_blank &gt;READ: China coronavirus cases exceed 17,000 nationwide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-coronavirus-wuhan-death-toll-spikes-more-than-sars-12385274" target=_blank &gt;READ: China's death toll from coronavirus surpasses SARS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hospital Authority said those using extreme means "to try to force the government and Hospital Authority’s hands will not succeed".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Striking workers at the Hospital Authority building booed as they watched Lam speak, calling her a liar and chanting: "Close all borders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical workers, members of the newly formed union, held a press conference shortly after Lam spoke and said they planned to keep up their strike action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAEA chairwoman Winnie Yu said she expected around 9,000 of the alliance's roughly 18,000 members to strike on Tuesday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HAEA's five demands are for the government to close the border, distribute masks to the public, ensure that front-line medical workers have adequate supplies and protection, provide enough isolation wards for patients and guarantee no reprisals for strikers.​​​​​​​&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-picture--article is-original" data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;img alt="Hong Kong closes China borders graphic" class="picture__image lazyload" data-src="/image/12386928/0x0/1536/1047/4fa22555204dd8cf9d1c8d3d9c7ec087/NA/hong-kong-closes-china-borders-graphic.jpg"/&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Graphic focussing on Hong Kong in the China virus crisis. (Image: AFP) &lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lam said the latest closures - which came after four crossings were shuttered last week - would reduce the number of Chinese mainlanders and allow officials to focus resources on two land entry points as well as the airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The numbers will come down," she told reporters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lam had already closed some border operations, including cross-border ferries and high-speed rail services to the mainland. She has said that closing the entire border would be "inappropriate and impractical" as well as "discriminatory".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also said that the city faces a shortage of masks, an issue that cannot be solved in a short period of time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong has 15 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, which emerged in central China in December and has killed more than 360 people there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents have &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-china-hong-kong-residents-stock-up-food-essentials-12385150" target=_blank &gt;emptied shelves in major supermarkets&lt;/a&gt; in Hong Kong, stockpiling meat, rice and cleaning products as fears escalate over the coronavirus outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 90 per cent of the city's food is imported, with the bulk coming from the mainland, according to official data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus is expected to pile pressure on the city's economy, which sank into recession in the third quarter as the often violent protests scared away tourists and took a heavy toll on retailers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Commentary: How effective are mass quarantines in China in curbing the spread of the novel coronavirus?</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.642775+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;LONDON: The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/wuhan-virus-who-international-emergency-declare-12372372" target=_blank &gt;international concern&lt;/a&gt;. China has recorded over 17,200 cases, but under 400 deaths from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as emerging diseases go, this virus appears relatively insipid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite the mild severity of this disease, over 50 million people in Hubei Province have been restricted to their region as Chinese authorities try to prevent the spread of the virus. Wuhan’s public health authorities say they are in a “state of war” and public transport has been shut down in several Chinese cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/china-wuhan-virus-lockdown-travel-flight-bus-quarantine-new-year-12372790" target=_self &gt;READ: Commentary: China in a novel coronavirus lockdown – life is normal but not really&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cordoning off ground zero is not unusual in public health emergencies. An outbreak of norovirus or salmonella may lead to restaurant closure. In the case of the novel coronavirus, the wet market from where it may have originated (in Wuhan) was similarly shut down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing the suspected source of the disease is necessary but not sufficient. Any public health response to a disease outbreak must prevent transmission of cases to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/wuhan-virus-coronavirus-tourism-worst-hit-countries-cities-china-12377622" target=_self &gt;READ: Commentary: Tourism in Asia takes a beating after novel coronavirus outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while isolation is a well-established practice for individual cases, quarantining millions of healthy people is unprecedented in public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across Asia, facemasks are back in vogue, with Alibaba selling 80 million over two days alone. Given the historical context, this is unsurprising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese are well acquainted with outbreaks of viral disease. Crystalline memories of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have re-emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/wuhan-virus-singapore-cases-response-sars-2003-quarantine-12360244" target=_self &gt;READ: Commentary: SARS was scary, but the experience was invaluable in shaping our novel coronavirus response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is this very context that raises the question: Is such a drastic response warranted?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ILLUSION OF INTERVENTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12362318/16x9/320/180/3e4f567ec66ae6d928de341f77b36fd/Zu/wuhan-empty-road.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12362318/16x9/360/203/3e4f567ec66ae6d928de341f77b36fd/MS/wuhan-empty-road.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12362318/16x9/450/253/3e4f567ec66ae6d928de341f77b36fd/tj/wuhan-empty-road.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12362318/16x9/550/309/3e4f567ec66ae6d928de341f77b36fd/Aq/wuhan-empty-road.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12362318/16x9/670/377/3e4f567ec66ae6d928de341f77b36fd/oS/wuhan-empty-road.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12362318/16x9/768/432/3e4f567ec66ae6d928de341f77b36fd/oC/wuhan-empty-road.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12362318/16x9/991/557/3e4f567ec66ae6d928de341f77b36fd/fs/wuhan-empty-road.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="An empty road is seen in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province on Jan 27, 2020" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; An empty road is seen in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province on Jan 27, 2020, amid a deadly virus outbreak which began in the city.

But in reality, it is no better than the usual public health response of isolating cases and potentially high-risk contacts of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going further to isolate those who have any theoretical risk of disease may allay public fear and provide the illusion of intervention, but it cannot be considered an evidence-based practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://bit.ly/38UB0lH" target=_self &gt;LISTEN: Novel coronavirus – The WHO, Singapore's infectious diseases authority and a global outbreak expert answer your burning questions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the argument for mass quarantine rests on the perilous assumption that one person’s risk of infection is the same as another’s, simply because they live in the same region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know this is not the case, particularly at an early stage in an outbreak, and that there are groups at higher risk who may be identified and targeted first before radical strategies that interfere with usual activities are considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/coronavirus-koreans-evacuated-from-wuhan-12374476" target=_self &gt;READ: Commentary: Coronavirus – Where should Koreans evacuated from Wuhan stay?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, any impediment to the day-to-day functions of healthcare and other infrastructure can be a huge problem for disease control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact tracing, disease surveillance, public education and administering protective equipment, drugs or vaccines, rely on effective communication with hospitals, primary care, laboratories and other institutions, such as schools or nursing homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Descending into a zombie-apocalypse scenario does not help in the operational coordination of complex cross-agency public health activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, a Chinese public health response must protect those within the affected region as well as those outside it. The current position ignores the rights of healthy people in and around Wuhan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12362384/16x9/320/180/587edb41d5fca1e68c81cc32ee3b54fd/oZ/wuhan-government-workers-spray-disinfectant.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12362384/16x9/360/203/587edb41d5fca1e68c81cc32ee3b54fd/ax/wuhan-government-workers-spray-disinfectant.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12362384/16x9/450/253/587edb41d5fca1e68c81cc32ee3b54fd/um/wuhan-government-workers-spray-disinfectant.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12362384/16x9/550/309/587edb41d5fca1e68c81cc32ee3b54fd/Zd/wuhan-government-workers-spray-disinfectant.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12362384/16x9/670/377/587edb41d5fca1e68c81cc32ee3b54fd/uB/wuhan-government-workers-spray-disinfectant.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12362384/16x9/768/432/587edb41d5fca1e68c81cc32ee3b54fd/eh/wuhan-government-workers-spray-disinfectant.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12362384/16x9/991/557/587edb41d5fca1e68c81cc32ee3b54fd/Nb/wuhan-government-workers-spray-disinfectant.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="Wuhan government workers spray disinfectant" class="picture__image lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt; &lt;figcaption class=picture__caption &gt; Government workers spray disinfectant along a street in Wuhan in central China's Hubei Province on Jan 28, 2020. (Photo: Chinatopix via AP)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;If we assume all currently recorded cases are within the city of Wuhan (of approximately 11 million) and not the wider region, then we can conservatively estimate that over 99 per cent of people are not cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While human-to-human transmission appears to be occurring, preliminary reports don’t suggest that this is a particularly infectious disease. For every one case, the WHO estimates that a further 1.4 to 2.5 (or an average of two) more people are infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To put this in perspective, for measles, an estimated 12 to 18 people will get infected from a single case.

The first week of quarantine has resulted in crowded hospitals, food shortages and the local economy grinding to a standstill. Amid such chaos, even the Chinese will struggle to prevent defectors from fleeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, it is unclear when it would be possible to lift such a lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HIGH PRICE TO PAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With cases increasing by the day, the quarantine looks like it is here to stay, but escalating economic and social pressures will loom large for decision-makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/wuhan-virus-coronavirus-parents-schools-precautions-measures-12374280" target=_self &gt;READ: Commentary: As a parent, I worry about my kids and the novel coronavirus situation.

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;BEIJING: China's unprecedented quarantining of virus-hit Wuhan has separated millions from their families - and many from their pets, prompting worried owners and kind strangers to take to social media to ensure left-behind animals are looked after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus that has &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-coronavirus-wuhan-death-toll-spikes-more-than-sars-12385274" target=_blank &gt;killed more than 360&lt;/a&gt; in China emerged during the Chinese New Year when hundreds of millions were travelling across the country, and the subsequent lockdown on Wuhan and central Hubei province has left many stranded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The hashtag "save the pets left behind in Wuhan" became the third-most searched term on the Twitter-like Weibo platform Monday (Feb 3), receiving millions of views from those unable to return to the city, where the virus is believed to have originated, and others willing to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=c-picture--article  data-css=c-picture &gt; &lt;figure class=picture__wrapper &gt; &lt;picture class=picture__container &gt; &lt;source data-srcset="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12386636/16x9/320/180/a51b4731d8e25cd380ebefce70beeb41/Uc/a-man-carries-his-dog-in-a-shopping-bag-at-a-pet-fair-in-shanghai--china-is-home-to-a-growing-population-of-pet-owners-with-pet-related-spending-in-china-reaching-nearly-24-billion-in-2018-1580731821998-2.jpg 320w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12386636/16x9/360/203/a51b4731d8e25cd380ebefce70beeb41/HA/a-man-carries-his-dog-in-a-shopping-bag-at-a-pet-fair-in-shanghai--china-is-home-to-a-growing-population-of-pet-owners-with-pet-related-spending-in-china-reaching-nearly-24-billion-in-2018-1580731821998-2.jpg 360w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12386636/16x9/450/253/a51b4731d8e25cd380ebefce70beeb41/CZ/a-man-carries-his-dog-in-a-shopping-bag-at-a-pet-fair-in-shanghai--china-is-home-to-a-growing-population-of-pet-owners-with-pet-related-spending-in-china-reaching-nearly-24-billion-in-2018-1580731821998-2.jpg 450w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12386636/16x9/550/309/a51b4731d8e25cd380ebefce70beeb41/xw/a-man-carries-his-dog-in-a-shopping-bag-at-a-pet-fair-in-shanghai--china-is-home-to-a-growing-population-of-pet-owners-with-pet-related-spending-in-china-reaching-nearly-24-billion-in-2018-1580731821998-2.jpg 550w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12386636/16x9/670/377/a51b4731d8e25cd380ebefce70beeb41/QM/a-man-carries-his-dog-in-a-shopping-bag-at-a-pet-fair-in-shanghai--china-is-home-to-a-growing-population-of-pet-owners-with-pet-related-spending-in-china-reaching-nearly-24-billion-in-2018-1580731821998-2.jpg 670w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12386636/16x9/768/432/a51b4731d8e25cd380ebefce70beeb41/aE/a-man-carries-his-dog-in-a-shopping-bag-at-a-pet-fair-in-shanghai--china-is-home-to-a-growing-population-of-pet-owners-with-pet-related-spending-in-china-reaching-nearly-24-billion-in-2018-1580731821998-2.jpg 768w, https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12386636/16x9/991/557/a51b4731d8e25cd380ebefce70beeb41/Ju/a-man-carries-his-dog-in-a-shopping-bag-at-a-pet-fair-in-shanghai--china-is-home-to-a-growing-population-of-pet-owners-with-pet-related-spending-in-china-reaching-nearly-24-billion-in-2018-1580731821998-2.jpg 991w" sizes="(min-width: 992px) 670px,(min-width: 768px) calc( 100vw - 50px ), calc( 100vw - 30px )"&gt; &lt;img alt="A man carries his dog in a shopping bag at a pet fair in Shanghai.

"I'm worried to death" the user, who posted anonymously, said. "I didn't let him hibernate this winter because he's a baby snake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That post had no takers as of late Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If any cats and dogs are stranded and you can let me in, I can help you feed them on livestream," wrote Katherine Cui in eastern Zhejiang province - where the city of Wenzhou was placed under a similar lockdown to Wuhan on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have many pets at home, and plenty of cat food, dog food and kitty litter, I know too well how important fur babies are."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drive to save pets comes after multiple Chinese media reports said apartment complexes had banned pets to stop the spread of the virus, as well as unverified reports that people had thrown animals to their deaths for similar reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-china-citizens-overseas-coronavirus-hubei-tourists-12372960" target=_blank &gt;READ: China to fly overseas citizens back to virus-hit Hubei province&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the novel coronavirus is believed to have crossed over from animals to humans at a Wuhan market known for selling live wildlife, the World Health Organization has said on its Weibo account there is "no evidence that dogs, cats and other pets can catch the novel coronavirus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China is home to a growing population of pet owners, with pet-related spending in China reaching 170.8 billion yuan (US$23.7 billion) in 2018, according to a report by Pet Fair Asia and pet website Goumin.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Chinese citizens turn to virus tracker apps to avoid infected neighbourhoods</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.642514+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;SHENZHEN, China: Chinese citizens are using mapping programmes and travel trackers in a bid to avoid neighborhoods with infections of the &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-china-new-cases-death-toll-12384204" target=_blank &gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; and to better prepare for the dangers they face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both data mapping company QuantUrban and a third-party Wechat mini-program developer have created platforms that take official information on the neighbourhoods where confirmed cases live and map it geographically so that users can guage how close they are to infection sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the WeChat program, called "YiKuang" - or "Epidemic Situation", covers the southern cities of Shenzhen and Guangzhou, QuantUrban's browser-based maps also cover nine other cities in the province.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Shenzhen might have a major outbreak in the next few days, and government data comes out slowly," said April, a Shenzhen-based manager who declined to give her full name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Seeing the map is a psychological comfort. You can't guarantee there won't be fresh cases, but you can avoid an area that's already hit," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confirmed cases in Shenzhen have climbed rapidly to 245 as of Monday, making the southern tech capital the worst-affected of China's main cities - Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. It has a large population of migrant workers from the heavily affected central provinces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We wanted to annotate the information on the map so that the public could better see how epidemic sites are distributed more intuitively, and also remind everyone to make adequate protection," said Yuan Xiaohui, QuantUrban’s co-founder and CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volunteers also help the team to keep the map up to date as the government releases data daily, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yikuang also relies on volunteers to keep up to date and originally denoted neighborhoods with confirmed cases with a skull and crossbones logo. It has since changed to less alarming exclamation points after users on social media platform Weibo complained they would cause panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I know that there are sick people nearby, I can take steps to be extra cautious," Steven Liu, a finance student, told Reuters. "I live between Shenzhen and Guangzhou, and these maps are really great there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;QuantUrban is also covering nine other cities in Guangdong province, Yuan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State-owned media CCTV and the People's Daily have also given their endorsement to separate programs that help users track whether a bus, train or aeroplane they have travelled on was also used by a confirmed infected patient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Pakistan bucks trend and resumes flights to virus-hit China</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.642464+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: Airlines in Pakistan resumed flights to and from China Monday (Feb 3) after health authorities said they were confident they had systems in place to keep the deadly coronavirus out of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move comes as dozens of global airlines are halting flight services with China, and governments are increasingly barring entry to anyone who has recently visited the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;China has long been an all-weather ally of Pakistan and in recent years has provided Islamabad with billions of dollars in loans as part of Beijing's global Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 28,000 to 30,000 Pakistanis are living in China, and more than 500 nationals are believed to be in Wuhan, where the virus originated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Flight operations with China have resumed," Zafar Mirza, a public health adviser to Prime Minister Imran Khan, told reporters Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I personally received passengers from China this morning. I checked the whole system step by step and we have not seen any suspected patients that needed to be kept under observation," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The decision was questioned by medical experts in the country, where investment in health care has been woefully lacking for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pakistan is not capable of treating the coronavirus," said Athar Niaz Rana, a senior medical practitioner at Islamabad's Shifa International Hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't have any facility to properly test suspected cases," he told AFP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Pakistan, but four students living in Wuhan have been infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are currently more than two dozen weekly flights between Pakistan and China, civil aviation authority spokesman Abdul Sattar Khokhar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Khan has visited China three times since taking office in 2018, and has repeatedly refused to criticise Beijing when asked about the country's treatment of its Muslim minorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;​​​​​​​&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;GENEVA: China told the World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday (Feb 3) that it had shared full information about the coronavirus with authorities in Taiwan, where there are 10 confirmed cases, and that outbreak communication had been "smooth" across the straits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;China's ambassador Li Song was speaking at the WHO's Executive Board in Geneva, after Eswatini took to the floor to object to Taiwan not having their own representatives to participate in the debates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taiwan is denied membership of most international bodies including the WHO, a UN agency, due to the objections of China, which considers the island a Chinese province with no right to participate unless it accepts that it is part of China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is something Taiwan's fiercely democratic government will not do. The head of the Taiwan foreign ministry's Department of International Organisations said on Sunday the department had complained repeatedly to the WHO to stop listing the island as part of China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-taiwan-china-who-flight-bans-update-delays-12385448" target=_blank &gt;READ: Shut out of WHO, Taiwan faces flight bans, update delays in novel coronavirus crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In response to the concerns of the people of Taiwan and in line with the principle of openness and transparency and in order to safeguard the health and well-being of compatriots on both side of the Taiwan Strait, the mainland has repeatedly and in a timely (way) notified Taiwan of the latest information of the prevention and control of the epidemic through normal channels," Li told the WHO talks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwan epidemic prevention experts had visited the Wuhan and Hubei province disease prevention and control centre in mid-January, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their concerns have also been given further answers," he added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"The smooth communication between two sides of the straits on infectious diseases has ensured the orderly prevention and control of the outbreak across the Straits," Li said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"This visit has further promoted communication and exchange in the health field across the Taiwan Strait," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-coronavirus-wuhan-death-toll-spikes-more-than-sars-12385274" target=_blank &gt;READ: China's death toll from coronavirus surpasses SARS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Li denounced what he called Taiwan's authorities "lies and excuses" related to its inability to attend WHO meetings, where the island regarded by Beijing as a renegade province is represented by the mainland - under WHO rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"There does not exist a so-called gap in the international epidemic prevention system as a result of Taiwan's non-attendance to the WHA (World Health Assembly)," he said, referring to the WHO ministerial-level meeting held every May.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Instead it is just the lies and excuses made by the Taiwan authority in an attempt to participate in the WHA," Li said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Philippines' Duterte says xenophobia against Chinese over coronavirus must stop</title>
    <updated>2020-02-03T16:12:17.642303+00:00</updated>
    <content>&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;MANILA: President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday (Feb 3) urged Philippine citizens to stop stirring up anti-Chinese xenophobia related to the &lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/wuhan-virus-china-new-cases-death-toll-12384204" target=_blank &gt;outbreak of a coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December and has since killed more than 300 and infected more than 17,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus outbreak has stoked a wave of anti-China sentiment around the globe, from shops barring entry to Chinese tourists, online mocking of the country's exotic meat trade and surprise health checks on foreign workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the Philippine capital, Adamson University asked all its Chinese students to observe a 14-day self-quarantine as a precaution. Criticism of that decision led the university to extend the quarantine to all students and staff who had travelled to areas where the virus was prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"China has been kind to us, we can only also show the same favour to them. Stop this xenophobia thing," Duterte said in a news conference after meeting with agencies on the coronavirus, which claimed its first fatality in the Philippines on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus has spread to more than a dozen countries, many of them in Southeast Asia, which has sensitive relations with China amid concerns about Beijing's political clout in the region and sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China-Philippines relations have often been frosty over maritime disputes, but ties have warmed under Duterte, who prefers not to provoke Beijing and wants to tap it for loans and investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;"They are blaming the Chinese that (the virus) came from China, but it could always incubate in some other place," said Duterte. He assured the public there was no reason to panic and that "everything is well" in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is not the fault of anybody. Not the Chinese, not the Filipino, no one," Duterte said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese Embassy in Manila said on Friday it was paying close attention to the epidemic in the Philippines and is communicating with its government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Philippines is host to dozens of offshore gambling operators that employ many Chinese workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese tourists accounted for 22 per cent of the 7.5 million visitors to the Philippines between January and November last year, making China the second-highest nation of origin for international travellers to the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To contain the spread of the virus, the Philippine on Sunday expanded its travel ban to include all foreigners coming from China, widening an earlier restriction that covered only those from Hubei province.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duterte said the government is looking at the possibility of using a drug rehabilitation facility donated by a Chinese philanthropist to quarantine Filipino evacuees from Hubei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topics/wuhan-virus" target=_blank &gt;BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage on the Wuhan coronavirus and its developments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Download our &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/app" target=_blank &gt;app&lt;/a&gt; or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: &lt;a href="https://cna.asia/telegram"&gt;https://cna.asia/telegram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>
